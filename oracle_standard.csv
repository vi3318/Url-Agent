For your reference:",HCM Tables and Views,,,,,,"This guide contains the information about tables within Oracle HCM Cloud and their columns, primary keys, and indexes. The guide also includes the information about views within Oracle HCM Cloud along with the columns and queries associated with each view. For your reference: Tables are the basic unit of data storage in Oracle HCM Cloud, where data is stored in rows and columns. For example, the PER_ASG_RESPONSIBILITIES table stores general information about a person's areas of responsibility defined by reference to existing workforce structures. This table stores attributes such as start and end date of responsibility, type of responsibility, status, organization, location, and assignment category. A view is a logical representation of a table or combination of tables. A view is a stored query that derives its data from the tables on which it is based. For example, the PER_DISPLAY_PHONES_V view shows attributes such as phone type, phone number, speed dial number, extension, country code, and person identifier.",3,https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/human-resources/oedmh/get-help-FA.html | https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/human-resources/oedmh/faiagentpreferences-18951.html | https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/human-resources/oedmh/index.html,0,0,200,text/html,158,2,
