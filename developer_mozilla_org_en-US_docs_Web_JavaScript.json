      "text_content": "JavaScript JavaScript ( JS ) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled ) programming language with first-class functions . While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js , Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat . JavaScript is a prototype-based , garbage-collected , dynamic language, supporting multiple paradigms such as imperative, functional, and object-oriented. JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval ), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities ), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString() ). This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM . The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). As soon as one browser implements a feature, we try to document it. This means that cases where some proposals for new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN articles may use some of those new features. Most of the time, this happens between the stages 3 and 4, and is usually before the spec is officially published. Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language â JavaScript is not \"Interpreted Java\" . Both \"Java\" and \"JavaScript\" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use. JavaScript documentation of core language features (pure ECMAScript , for the most part) includes the following: The JavaScript guide The JavaScript reference For more information about JavaScript specifications and related technologies, see JavaScript technologies overview . Beginner's tutorials Our learn web development core modules contain modern, up-to-date tutorials covering JavaScript fundamentals. Your first website: Adding interactivity This article provides a brief tour of what JavaScript is and how to use it, aimed at people who are completely new to web development. Dynamic scripting with JavaScript This module focuses on the essentials of the core JavaScript language, plus some key surrounding topics â learning these topics will give you a solid basis to work from. JavaScript frameworks and libraries JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web development, providing developers with tried and tested tools for building scalable, interactive web applications. Many modern companies use frameworks as a standard part of their tooling, so many front-end development jobs now require framework experience. This set of articles provides a comfortable starting point to help you begin learning frameworks. JavaScript guides Fundamental language guides JavaScript Guide A much more detailed guide to the JavaScript language, aimed at those with previous programming experience either in JavaScript or another language. Intermediate Advanced JavaScript objects The object-oriented nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code, therefore we've provided this module to help you. Asynchronous JavaScript In this module, we take a look at asynchronous JavaScript, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations, such as fetching resources from a server. Client-side web APIs Explores what APIs are, and how to use some of the most common APIs you'll come across often in your development work. JavaScript language overview An overview of the basic syntax and semantics of JavaScript for those coming from other programming languages to get up to speed. JavaScript data structures Overview of available data structures in JavaScript. Equality comparisons and sameness JavaScript provides three different value comparison operations: strict equality using === , loose equality using == , and the Object.is() method. Enumerability and ownership of properties How different methods that visit a group of object properties one-by-one handle the enumerability and ownership of properties. Closures A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. Advanced Inheritance and the prototype chain Explanation of the widely misunderstood and underestimated prototype-based inheritance. Memory Management Memory life cycle and garbage collection in JavaScript. Reference Browse the complete JavaScript reference documentation. Standard objects Get to know standard built-in objects: Array , Boolean , Error , Function , JSON , Math , Number , Object , RegExp , String , Map , Set , WeakMap , WeakSet , and others. Expressions and operators Learn more about the behavior of JavaScript's operators instanceof , typeof , new , this , the operator precedence , and more. Statements and declarations Learn how do-while , for-in , for-of , try-catch , let , var , const , if-else , switch , and more JavaScript statements and keywords work. Functions Learn how to work with JavaScript's functions to develop your applications. Classes JavaScript classes are the most appropriate way to do object-oriented programming.

The term \"global objects\" (or standard built-in objects) here is not to be confused with the global object . Here, \"global objects\" refer to objects in the global scope . The global object itself can be accessed using the this operator in the global scope. In fact, the global scope consists of the properties of the global object, including inherited properties, if any. Other objects in the global scope are either created by the user script or provided by the host application. The host objects available in browser contexts are documented in the API reference . For more information about the distinction between the DOM and core JavaScript , see JavaScript technologies overview . Standard objects by category Value properties These global properties return a simple value. They have no properties or methods. globalThis Infinity NaN undefined Function properties These global functionsâfunctions which are called globally, rather than on an objectâdirectly return their results to the caller. eval() isFinite() isNaN() parseFloat() parseInt() decodeURI() decodeURIComponent() encodeURI() encodeURIComponent() escape() Deprecated unescape() Deprecated Fundamental objects These objects represent fundamental language constructs. Object Function Boolean Symbol Error objects Error objects are a special type of fundamental object. They include the basic Error type, as well as several specialized error types. Error AggregateError EvalError RangeError ReferenceError SuppressedError SyntaxError TypeError URIError InternalError Non-standard Numbers and dates These are the base objects representing numbers, dates, and mathematical calculations. Number BigInt Math Date Temporal Text processing These objects represent strings and support manipulating them. String RegExp Indexed collections These objects represent collections of data which are ordered by an index value. This includes (typed) arrays and array-like constructs. Array TypedArray Int8Array Uint8Array Uint8ClampedArray Int16Array Uint16Array Int32Array Uint32Array BigInt64Array BigUint64Array Float16Array Float32Array Float64Array Keyed collections These objects represent collections which use keys. The iterable collections ( Map and Set ) contain elements which are easily iterated in the order of insertion. Map Set WeakMap WeakSet Structured data These objects represent and interact with structured data buffers and data coded using JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

      "text_content": "Expressions and operators This chapter documents all the JavaScript language operators, expressions and keywords. Expressions and operators by category For an alphabetical listing see the sidebar on the left. Primary expressions Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript. These expressions have the highest precedence (higher than operators ). this The this keyword refers to a special property of an execution context. Literals Basic null , boolean, number, and string literals. [] Array initializer/literal syntax. {} Object initializer/literal syntax. function The function keyword defines a function expression. class The class keyword defines a class expression. function* The function* keyword defines a generator function expression. async function The async function defines an async function expression. async function* The async function* keywords define an async generator function expression. /ab+c/i Regular expression literal syntax. `string` Template literal syntax. ( ) Grouping operator. Left-hand-side expressions Left values are the destination of an assignment. Property accessors Member operators provide access to a property or method of an object ( object.property and object[\"property\"] ). ?. The optional chaining operator returns undefined instead of causing an error if a reference is nullish ( null or undefined ). new The new operator creates an instance of a constructor. new.target In constructors, new.target refers to the constructor that was invoked by new . import.meta An object exposing context-specific metadata to a JavaScript module. super The super keyword calls the parent constructor or allows accessing properties of the parent object. import() The import() syntax allows loading a module asynchronously and dynamically into a potentially non-module environment. Increment and decrement Postfix/prefix increment and postfix/prefix decrement operators. A++ Postfix increment operator. A-- Postfix decrement operator. ++A Prefix increment operator. --A Prefix decrement operator. Unary operators A unary operation is an operation with only one operand. delete The delete operator deletes a property from an object. void The void operator evaluates an expression and discards its return value. typeof The typeof operator determines the type of a given object. + The unary plus operator converts its operand to Number type. - The unary negation operator converts its operand to Number type and then negates it. ~ Bitwise NOT operator. ! Logical NOT operator. await Pause and resume an async function and wait for the promise's fulfillment/rejection. Arithmetic operators Arithmetic operators take numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and return a single numerical value. ** Exponentiation operator. * Multiplication operator. / Division operator. % Remainder operator. + (Plus) Addition operator. - Subtraction operator. Relational operators A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a boolean value based on whether the comparison is true. < (Less than) Less than operator. > (Greater than) Greater than operator. <= Less than or equal operator. >= Greater than or equal operator. instanceof The instanceof operator determines whether an object is an instance of another object. in The in operator determines whether an object has a given property. Note: => is not an operator, but the notation for Arrow functions . Equality operators The result of evaluating an equality operator is always of type boolean based on whether the comparison is true. == Equality operator. != Inequality operator. === Strict equality operator. !== Strict inequality operator. Bitwise shift operators Operations to shift all bits of the operand. << Bitwise left shift operator. >> Bitwise right shift operator. >>> Bitwise unsigned right shift operator. Binary bitwise operators Bitwise operators treat their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones) and return standard JavaScript numerical values. & Bitwise AND. | Bitwise OR. ^ Bitwise XOR. Binary logical operators Logical operators implement boolean (logical) values and have short-circuiting behavior. && Logical AND. || Logical OR. ?? Nullish Coalescing Operator. Conditional (ternary) operator (condition ? ifTrue : ifFalse) The conditional operator returns one of two values based on the logical value of the condition. Assignment operators An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. = Assignment operator. *= Multiplication assignment. /= Division assignment. %= Remainder assignment. += Addition assignment. -= Subtraction assignment <<= Left shift assignment. >>= Right shift assignment. >>>= Unsigned right shift assignment. &= Bitwise AND assignment. ^= Bitwise XOR assignment. |= Bitwise OR assignment. **= Exponentiation assignment. &&= Logical AND assignment. ||= Logical OR assignment. ??= Nullish coalescing assignment. [a, b] = arr , { a, b } = obj Destructuring allows you to assign the properties of an array or object to variables using syntax that looks similar to array or object literals. Yield operators yield Pause and resume a generator function. yield* Delegate to another generator function or iterable object. Spread syntax ...obj Spread syntax allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. In an object literal, the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created. Comma operator , The comma operator allows multiple expressions to be evaluated in a single statement and returns the result of the last expression.

Multiple statements may occur on a single line if each statement is separated by a semicolon. This isn't a keyword, but a group of keywords. Statements and declarations by category For an alphabetical listing see the sidebar on the left. Control flow return Specifies the value to be returned by a function. break Terminates the current loop, switch, or label statement and transfers program control to the statement following the terminated statement. continue Terminates execution of the statements in the current iteration of the current or labeled loop, and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration. throw Throws a user-defined exception. if...else Executes a statement if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false, another statement can be executed. switch Evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case. try...catch Marks a block of statements to try, and specifies a response, should an exception be thrown. Declaring variables var Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value. let Declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value. const Declares a read-only named constant. using Declares local variables that are synchronously disposed . await using Declares local variables that are asynchronously disposed . Functions and classes function Declares a function with the specified parameters. function* Generator Functions enable writing iterators more easily. async function Declares an async function with the specified parameters. async function* Asynchronous Generator Functions enable writing async iterators more easily. class Declares a class. Iterations do...while Creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to false.

The condition is evaluated before executing the statement. Others Empty An empty statement is used to provide no statement, although the JavaScript syntax would expect one. Block A block statement is used to group zero or more statements. The block is delimited by a pair of curly braces. Expression statement An expression statement evaluates an expression and discards its result. It allows the expression to perform side effects, such as executing a function or updating a variable. debugger Invokes any available debugging functionality. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect. export Used to export functions to make them available for imports in external modules, and other scripts. import Used to import functions exported from an external module, another script. label Provides a statement with an identifier that you can refer to using a break or continue statement. with Deprecated Extends the scope chain for a statement. Difference between statements and declarations In this section, we will be mixing two kinds of constructs: statements and declarations . They are two disjoint sets of grammars. The following are declarations: let const function function* async function async function* class export (Note: it can only appear at the top-level of a module ) import (Note: it can only appear at the top-level of a module ) Everything else in the list above is a statement. The terms \"statement\" and \"declaration\" have a precise meaning in the formal syntax of JavaScript that affects where they may be placed in code. For example, in most control-flow structures, the body only accepts statements â such as the two arms of an if...else : js if (condition) statement1; else statement2; If you use a declaration instead of a statement, it would be a SyntaxError . For example, a let declaration is not a statement, so you can't use it in its bare form as the body of an if statement. js if (condition) let i = 0; // SyntaxError: Lexical declaration cannot appear in a single-statement context On the other hand, var is a statement, so you can use it on its own as the if body. js if (condition) var i = 0; You can see declarations as \" binding identifiers to values\", and statements as \"carrying out actions\". The fact that var is a statement instead of a declaration is a special case, because it doesn't follow normal lexical scoping rules and may create side effects â in the form of creating global variables, mutating existing var -defined variables, and defining variables that are visible outside of its block (because var -defined variables aren't block-scoped). As another example, labels can only be attached to statements. js label: const a = 1; // SyntaxError: Lexical declaration cannot appear in a single-statement context Note: There's a legacy grammar that allows function declarations to have labels , but it's only standardized for compatibility with web reality. To get around this, you can wrap the declaration in braces â this makes it part of a block statement . js label: { const a = 1; } if (condition) { let i = 0; } Browser compatibility See also Expressions and operators Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on Jul 29, 2025 by MDN contributors .

Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback Generally speaking, a function is a \"subprogram\" that can be called by code external (or internal, in the case of recursion) to the function. Like the program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body . Values can be passed to a function as parameters, and the function will return a value. In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects , because they can be passed to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables and properties. They can also have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called. For more examples and explanations, see the JavaScript guide about functions . Description Function values are typically instances of Function . See Function for information on properties and methods of Function objects. Callable values cause typeof to return \"function\" instead of \"object\" . Note: Not all callable values are instanceof Function . For example, the Function.prototype object is callable but not an instance of Function . You can also manually set the prototype chain of your function so it no longer inherits from Function.prototype . However, such cases are extremely rare. Return value By default, if a function's execution doesn't end at a return statement, or if the return keyword doesn't have an expression after it, then the return value is undefined . The return statement allows you to return an arbitrary value from the function. One function call can only return one value, but you can simulate the effect of returning multiple values by returning an object or array and destructuring the result. Note: Constructors called with new have a different set of logic to determine their return values. Passing arguments Parameters and arguments have slightly different meanings, but in MDN web docs, we often use them interchangeably. For a quick reference: js function formatNumber(num) { return num.toFixed(2); } formatNumber(2); In this example, the num variable is called the function's parameter : it's declared in the parenthesis-enclosed list of the function's definition. The function expects the num parameter to be a number â although this is not enforceable in JavaScript without writing runtime validation code. In the formatNumber(2) call, the number 2 is the function's argument : it's the value that is actually passed to the function in the function call. The argument value can be accessed inside the function body through the corresponding parameter name or the arguments object. Arguments are always passed by value and never passed by reference . This means that if a function reassigns a parameter, the value won't change outside the function. More precisely, object arguments are passed by sharing , which means if the object's properties are mutated, the change will impact the outside of the function. For example: js function updateBrand(obj) { // Mutating the object is visible outside the function obj.brand = \"Toyota\"; // Try to reassign the parameter, but this won't affect // the variable's value outside the function obj = null; } const car = { brand: \"Honda\", model: \"Accord\", year: 1998, }; console.log(car.brand); // Honda // Pass object reference to the function updateBrand(car); // updateBrand mutates car console.log(car.brand); // Toyota The this keyword refers to the object that the function is accessed on â it does not refer to the currently executing function, so you must refer to the function value by name, even within the function body. Defining functions Broadly speaking, JavaScript has four kinds of functions: Regular function: can return anything; always runs to completion after invocation Generator function: returns a Generator object; can be paused and resumed with the yield operator Async function: returns a Promise ; can be paused and resumed with the await operator Async generator function: returns an AsyncGenerator object; both the await and yield operators can be used For every kind of function, there are multiple ways to define it: Declaration function , function* , async function , async function* Expression function , function* , async function , async function* Constructor Function() , GeneratorFunction() , AsyncFunction() , AsyncGeneratorFunction() In addition, there are special syntaxes for defining arrow functions and methods , which provide more precise semantics for their usage. Classes are conceptually not functions (because they throw an error when called without new ), but they also inherit from Function.prototype and have typeof MyClass === \"function\" . js // Constructor const multiply = new Function(\"x\", \"y\", \"return x * y\"); // Declaration function multiply(x, y) { return x * y; } // No need for semicolon here // Expression; the function is anonymous but assigned to a variable const multiply = function (x, y) { return x * y; }; // Expression; the function has its own name const multiply = function funcName(x, y) { return x * y; }; // Arrow function const multiply = (x, y) => x * y; // Method const obj = { multiply(x, y) { return x * y; }, }; All syntaxes do approximately the same thing, but there are some subtle behavior differences. The Function() constructor, function expression, and function declaration syntaxes create full-fledged function objects, which can be constructed with new . However, arrow functions and methods cannot be constructed. Async functions, generator functions, and async generator functions are not constructible regardless of syntax. The function declaration creates functions that are hoisted . Other syntaxes do not hoist the function and the function value is only visible after the definition. The arrow function and Function() constructor always create anonymous functions, which means they can't easily call themselves recursively. One way to call an arrow function recursively is by assigning it to a variable. The arrow function syntax does not have access to arguments or this . The Function() constructor cannot access any local variables â it only has access to the global scope. The Function() constructor causes runtime compilation and is often slower than other syntaxes. For function expressions, there is a distinction between the function name and the variable the function is assigned to. The function name cannot be changed, while the variable the function is assigned to can be reassigned. The function name can be different from the variable the function is assigned to â they have no relation to each other. The function name can be used only within the function's body. Attempting to use it outside the function's body results in an error (or gets another value, if the same name is declared elsewhere). For example: js const y = function x() {}; console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined On the other hand, the variable the function is assigned to is limited only by its scope, which is guaranteed to include the scope in which the function is declared. A function declaration also creates a variable with the same name as the function name. Thus, unlike those defined by function expressions, functions defined by function declarations can be accessed by their name in the scope they were defined in, as well as in their own body. A function defined by new Function will dynamically have its source assembled, which is observable when you serialize it. For example, console.log(new Function().toString()) gives: js function anonymous( ) { } This is the actual source used to compile the function. However, although the Function() constructor will create the function with name anonymous , this name is not added to the scope of the body. The body only ever has access to global variables. For example, the following would result in an error: js new Function(\"alert(anonymous);\")(); A function defined by a function expression or by a function declaration inherits the current scope. That is, the function forms a closure. On the other hand, a function defined by a Function constructor does not inherit any scope other than the global scope (which all functions inherit). js // p is a global variable globalThis.p = 5; function myFunc() { // p is a local variable const p = 9; function decl() { console.log(p); } const expr = function () { console.log(p); }; const cons = new Function(\"\\tconsole.log(p);\"); decl(); expr(); cons(); } myFunc(); // Logs: // 9 (for 'decl' by function declaration (current scope)) // 9 (for 'expr' by function expression (current scope)) // 5 (for 'cons' by Function constructor (global scope)) Functions defined by function expressions and function declarations are parsed only once, while a function defined by the Function constructor parses the string passed to it each and every time the constructor is called. Although a function expression creates a closure every time, the function body is not reparsed, so function expressions are still faster than new Function(...) . Therefore the Function constructor should generally be avoided whenever possible. A function declaration may be unintentionally turned into a function expression when it appears in an expression context. js // A function declaration function foo() { console.log(\"FOO!\"); } doSomething( // A function expression passed as an argument function foo() { console.log(\"FOO!\"); }, ); On the other hand, a function expression may also be turned into a function declaration. An expression statement cannot begin with the function or async function keywords, which is a common mistake when implementing IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions). js function () { // SyntaxError: Function statements require a function name console.log(\"FOO!\"); }(); function foo() { console.log(\"FOO!\"); }(); // SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')' Instead, start the expression statement with something else, so that the function keyword unambiguously starts a function expression. Common options include grouping and using void . js (function () { console.log(\"FOO!\"); })(); void function () { console.log(\"FOO!\"); }(); Function parameters Each function parameter is a simple identifier that you can access in the local scope. js function myFunc(a, b, c) { // You can access the values of a, b, and c here } There are three special parameter syntaxes: Default parameters allow formal parameters to be initialized with default values if no value or undefined is passed. The rest parameter allows representing an indefinite number of arguments as an array. Destructuring allows unpacking elements from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables. js function myFunc({ a, b }, c = 1, ...rest) { // You can access the values of a, b, c, and rest here } There are some consequences if one of the above non-simple parameter syntaxes is used: You cannot apply \"use strict\" to the function body â this causes a syntax error . Even if the function is not in strict mode , certain strict mode function features apply, including that the arguments object stops syncing with the named parameters, arguments.callee throws an error when accessed, and duplicate parameter names are not allowed. The arguments object You can refer to a function's arguments within the function by using the arguments object. arguments An array-like object containing the arguments passed to the currently executing function. arguments.callee The currently executing function. arguments.length The number of arguments passed to the function. Getter and setter functions You can define accessor properties on any standard built-in object or user-defined object that supports the addition of new properties. Within object literals and classes , you can use special syntaxes to define the getter and setter of an accessor property. get Binds an object property to a function that will be called when that property is looked up. set Binds an object property to a function to be called when there is an attempt to set that property. Note that these syntaxes create an object property , not a method . The getter and setter functions themselves can only be accessed using reflective APIs such as Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() . Block-level functions In strict mode , functions inside blocks are scoped to that block. Prior to ES2015, block-level functions were forbidden in strict mode. js \"use strict\"; function f() { return 1; } { function f() { return 2; } } f() === 1; // true // f() === 2 in non-strict mode Block-level functions in non-strict code In a word: Don't. In non-strict code, function declarations inside blocks behave strangely. For example: js if (shouldDefineZero) { function zero() { // DANGER: compatibility risk console.log(\"This is zero.\"); } } The semantics of this in strict mode are well-specified â zero only ever exists within that scope of the if block. If shouldDefineZero is false, then zero should never be defined, since the block never executes. However, historically, this was left unspecified, so different browsers implemented it differently in non-strict mode. For more information, see the function declaration reference. A safer way to define functions conditionally is to assign a function expression to a variable: js // Using a var makes it available as a global variable, // with closer behavior to a top-level function declaration var zero; if (shouldDefineZero) { zero = function () { console.log(\"This is zero.\"); }; } Examples Returning a formatted number The following function returns a string containing the formatted representation of a number padded with leading zeros. js // This function returns a string padded with leading zeros function padZeros(num, totalLen) { let numStr = num.toString(); // Initialize return value as string const numZeros = totalLen - numStr.length; // Calculate no. of zeros for (let i = 1; i <= numZeros; i++) { numStr = `0${numStr}`; } return numStr; } The following statements call the padZeros function. js let result; result = padZeros(42, 4); // returns \"0042\" result = padZeros(42, 2); // returns \"42\" result = padZeros(5, 4); // returns \"0005\" Determining whether a function exists You can determine whether a function exists by using the typeof operator. In the following example, a test is performed to determine if the window object has a property called noFunc that is a function. If so, it is used; otherwise, some other action is taken. js if (typeof window.noFunc === \"function\") { // use noFunc() } else { // do something else } Note that in the if test, a reference to noFunc is used â there are no parentheses () after the function name so the actual function is not called.

      "text_content": "Control flow and error handling Previous Next JavaScript supports a compact set of statements, specifically control flow statements, that you can use to incorporate a great deal of interactivity in your application. This chapter provides an overview of these statements. The JavaScript reference contains exhaustive details about the statements in this chapter. The semicolon ( ; ) character is used to separate statements in JavaScript code. Any JavaScript expression is also a statement. See Expressions and operators for complete information about expressions. Block statement The most basic statement is a block statement , which is used to group statements. The block is delimited by a pair of curly braces: js { statement1; statement2; // â¦ statementN; } Example Block statements are commonly used with control flow statements ( if , for , while ). js while (x < 10) { x++; } Here, { x++; } is the block statement. Note: var -declared variables are not block-scoped, but are scoped to the containing function or script, and the effects of setting them persist beyond the block itself. For example: js var x = 1; { var x = 2; } console.log(x); // 2 This outputs 2 because the var x statement within the block is in the same scope as the var x statement before the block. (In C or Java, the equivalent code would have output 1 .) This scoping effect can be mitigated by using let or const . Conditional statements A conditional statement is a set of commands that executes if a specified condition is true. JavaScript supports two conditional statements: if...else and switch . if...else statement Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true . Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false . An if statement looks like this: js if (condition) { statement1; } else { statement2; } Here, the condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false . (See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false .) If condition evaluates to true , statement1 is executed. Otherwise, statement2 is executed. statement1 and statement2 can be any statement, including further nested if statements. You can also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows: js if (condition1) { statement1; } else if (condition2) { statement2; } else if (conditionN) { statementN; } else { statementLast; } In the case of multiple conditions, only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ( { /* â¦ */ } ). Best practice In general, it's good practice to always use block statementsâ especially when nesting if statements: js if (condition) { // Statements for when condition is true // â¦ } else { // Statements for when condition is false // â¦ } In general it's good practice to not have an if...else with an assignment like x = y as a condition: js if (x = y) { // statements here } However, in the rare case you find yourself wanting to do something like that, the while documentation has a Using an assignment as a condition section with guidance on a general best-practice syntax you should know about and follow. Falsy values The following values evaluate to false (also known as Falsy values): false undefined null 0 NaN the empty string ( \"\" ) All other valuesâincluding all objectsâevaluate to true when passed to a conditional statement. Note: Do not confuse the primitive boolean values true and false with the true and false values of the Boolean object! For example: js const b = new Boolean(false); if (b) { // this condition evaluates to true } if (b == true) { // this condition evaluates to false } Example In the following example, the function checkData returns true if the number of characters in a Text object is three. Otherwise, it displays an alert and returns false . js function checkData() { if (document.form1.threeChar.value.length === 3) { return true; } alert( `Enter exactly three characters. ${document.form1.threeChar.value} is not valid.`, ); return false; } switch statement A switch statement allows a program to evaluate an expression and attempt to match the expression's value to a case label. If a match is found, the program executes the associated statement. A switch statement looks like this: js switch (expression) { case label1: statements1; break; case label2: statements2; break; // â¦ default: statementsDefault; } JavaScript evaluates the above switch statement as follows: The program first looks for a case clause with a label matching the value of expression and then transfers control to that clause, executing the associated statements. If no matching label is found, the program looks for the optional default clause: If a default clause is found, the program transfers control to that clause, executing the associated statements. If no default clause is found, the program resumes execution at the statement following the end of switch . (By convention, the default clause is written as the last clause, but it does not need to be so.) break statements The optional break statement associated with each case clause ensures that the program breaks out of switch once the matched statement is executed, and then continues execution at the statement following switch . If break is omitted, the program continues execution inside the switch statement (and will execute statements under the next case , and so on). Example In the following example, if fruitType evaluates to \"Bananas\" , the program matches the value with case \"Bananas\" and executes the associated statement. When break is encountered, the program exits the switch and continues execution from the statement following switch . If break were omitted, the statement for case \"Cherries\" would also be executed. js switch (fruitType) { case \"Oranges\": console.log(\"Oranges are $0.59 a pound.\"); break; case \"Apples\": console.log(\"Apples are $0.32 a pound.\"); break; case \"Bananas\": console.log(\"Bananas are $0.48 a pound.\"); break; case \"Cherries\": console.log(\"Cherries are $3.00 a pound.\"); break; case \"Mangoes\": console.log(\"Mangoes are $0.56 a pound.\"); break; case \"Papayas\": console.log(\"Papayas are $2.79 a pound.\"); break; default: console.log(`Sorry, we are out of ${fruitType}.`); } console.log(\"Is there anything else you'd like?\"); Exception handling statements You can throw exceptions using the throw statement and handle them using the try...catch statements. throw statement try...catch statement Exception types Just about any object can be thrown in JavaScript. Nevertheless, not all thrown objects are created equal. While it is common to throw numbers or strings as errors, it is frequently more effective to use one of the exception types specifically created for this purpose: ECMAScript exceptions DOMException throw statement Use the throw statement to throw an exception. A throw statement specifies the value to be thrown: js throw expression; You may throw any expression, not just expressions of a specific type. The following code throws several exceptions of varying types: js throw \"Error2\"; // String type throw 42; // Number type throw true; // Boolean type throw { toString() { return \"I'm an object!\"; }, }; try...catch statement The try...catch statement marks a block of statements to try, and specifies one or more responses should an exception be thrown. If an exception is thrown, the try...catch statement catches it. The try...catch statement consists of a try block, which contains one or more statements, and a catch block, containing statements that specify what to do if an exception is thrown in the try block. In other words, you want the try block to succeedâbut if it does not, you want control to pass to the catch block. If any statement within the try block (or in a function called from within the try block) throws an exception, control immediately shifts to the catch block. If no exception is thrown in the try block, the catch block is skipped. The finally block executes after the try and catch blocks execute but before the statements following the try...catch statement. The following example uses a try...catch statement. The example calls a function that retrieves a month name from an array based on the value passed to the function. If the value does not correspond to a month number ( 1 â 12 ), an exception is thrown with the value 'Invalid month code' and the statements in the catch block set the monthName variable to 'unknown' . js function getMonthName(mo) { mo--; // Adjust month number for array index (so that 0 = Jan, 11 = Dec) // prettier-ignore const months = [ \"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Nov\", \"Dec\", ]; if (!months[mo]) { throw new Error(\"Invalid month code\"); // throw keyword is used here } return months[mo]; } try { // statements to try monthName = getMonthName(myMonth); // function could throw exception } catch (e) { monthName = \"unknown\"; logMyErrors(e); // pass exception object to error handler (i.e. your own function) } The catch block You can use a catch block to handle all exceptions that may be generated in the try block. js catch (exception) { statements } The catch block specifies an identifier ( exception in the preceding syntax) that holds the value specified by the throw statement. You can use this identifier to get information about the exception that was thrown. JavaScript creates this identifier when the catch block is entered. The identifier lasts only for the duration of the catch block. Once the catch block finishes executing, the identifier no longer exists. For example, the following code throws an exception. When the exception occurs, control transfers to the catch block. js try { throw \"myException\"; // generates an exception } catch (err) { // statements to handle any exceptions logMyErrors(err); // pass exception object to error handler } Note: When logging errors to the console inside a catch block, using console.error() rather than console.log() is advised for debugging. It formats the message as an error, and adds it to the list of error messages generated by the page. The finally block The finally block contains statements to be executed after the try and catch blocks execute. Additionally, the finally block executes before the code that follows the try...catch...finally statement. It is also important to note that the finally block will execute whether or not an exception is thrown. If an exception is thrown, however, the statements in the finally block execute even if no catch block handles the exception that was thrown. You can use the finally block to make your script fail gracefully when an exception occurs. For example, you may need to release a resource that your script has tied up. The following example opens a file and then executes statements that use the file. (Server-side JavaScript allows you to access files.) If an exception is thrown while the file is open, the finally block closes the file before the script fails. Using finally here ensures that the file is never left open, even if an error occurs. js openMyFile(); try { writeMyFile(theData); // This may throw an error } catch (e) { handleError(e); // If an error occurred, handle it } finally { closeMyFile(); // Always close the resource } If the finally block returns a value, this value becomes the return value of the entire try...catch...finally production, regardless of any return statements in the try and catch blocks: js function f() { try { console.log(0); throw \"bogus\"; } catch (e) { console.log(1); // This return statement is suspended // until finally block has completed return true; console.log(2); // not reachable } finally { console.log(3); return false; // overwrites the previous \"return\" // `f` exits here console.log(4); // not reachable } console.log(5); // not reachable } console.log(f()); // 0, 1, 3, false Overwriting of return values by the finally block also applies to exceptions thrown or re-thrown inside of the catch block: js function f() { try { throw \"bogus\"; } catch (e) { console.log('caught inner \"bogus\"'); // This throw statement is suspended until // finally block has completed throw e; } finally { return false; // overwrites the previous \"throw\" // `f` exits here } } try { console.log(f()); } catch (e) { // this is never reached! // while f() executes, the `finally` block returns false, // which overwrites the `throw` inside the above `catch` console.log('caught outer \"bogus\"'); } // Logs: // caught inner \"bogus\" // false Nesting try...catch statements You can nest one or more try...catch statements. If an inner try block does not have a corresponding catch block: it must contain a finally block, and the enclosing try...catch statement's catch block is checked for a match. For more information, see nested try-blocks on the try...catch reference page. Utilizing Error objects Depending on the type of error, you may be able to use the name and message properties to get a more refined message. The name property provides the general class of Error (such as DOMException or Error ), while message generally provides a more succinct message than one would get by converting the error object to a string. If you are throwing your own exceptions, in order to take advantage of these properties (such as if your catch block doesn't discriminate between your own exceptions and system ones), you can use the Error constructor. For example: js function doSomethingErrorProne() { if (ourCodeMakesAMistake()) { throw new Error(\"The message\"); } doSomethingToGetAJavaScriptError(); } try { doSomethingErrorProne(); } catch (e) { // Now, we actually use `console.error()` console.error(e.name); // 'Error' console.error(e.message); // 'The message', or a JavaScript error message } Previous Next Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on Sep 19, 2025 by MDN contributors .

      "text_content": "Loops and iteration Previous Next Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript. You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea \"Go five steps to the east\" could be expressed this way as a loop: js for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) { // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4. console.log(\"Walking east one step\"); } There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!) The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others. The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are: for statement do...while statement while statement labeled statement break statement continue statement for...in statement for...of statement for statement A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop. A for statement looks as follows: js for (initialization; condition; afterthought) statement When a for loop executes, the following occurs: The initializing expression initialization , if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables. The condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition is true, the loop statements execute. Otherwise, the for loop terminates. (If the condition expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.) The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ( { } ) to group those statements. If present, the update expression afterthought is executed. Control returns to Step 2. Example In the example below, the function contains a for statement that counts the number of selected options in a scrolling list (a <select> element that allows multiple selections). HTML html <form name=\"selectForm\"> <label for=\"musicTypes\" >Choose some music types, then click the button below:</label > <select id=\"musicTypes\" name=\"musicTypes\" multiple> <option selected>R&amp;B</option> <option>Jazz</option> <option>Blues</option> <option>New Age</option> <option>Classical</option> <option>Opera</option> </select> <button id=\"btn\" type=\"button\">How many are selected?</button> </form> JavaScript Here, the for statement declares the variable i and initializes it to 0 . It checks that i is less than the number of options in the <select> element, performs the succeeding if statement, and increments i by 1 after each pass through the loop. js function countSelected(selectObject) { let numberSelected = 0; for (let i = 0; i < selectObject.options.length; i++) { if (selectObject.options[i].selected) { numberSelected++; } } return numberSelected; } const btn = document.getElementById(\"btn\"); btn.addEventListener(\"click\", () => { const musicTypes = document.selectForm.musicTypes; console.log(`You have selected ${countSelected(musicTypes)} option(s).`); }); do...while statement The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. A do...while statement looks as follows: js do statement while (condition); statement is always executed once before the condition is checked. (To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ( { } ) to group those statements.) If condition is true , the statement executes again. At the end of every execution, the condition is checked. When the condition is false , execution stops, and control passes to the statement following do...while . Example In the following example, the do loop iterates at least once and reiterates until i is no longer less than 5 . js let i = 0; do { i += 1; console.log(i); } while (i < 5); while statement A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true . A while statement looks as follows: js while (condition) statement If the condition becomes false , statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop. The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true , statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false , execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while . To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ( { } ) to group those statements. Example 1 The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than 3 : js let n = 0; let x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; } With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x . Therefore, x and n take on the following values: After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1 After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3 After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6 After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer true , so the loop terminates. Example 2 Avoid infinite loops. Make sure the condition in a loop eventually becomes false âotherwise, the loop will never terminate! The statements in the following while loop execute forever because the condition never becomes false : js // Infinite loops are bad! while (true) { console.log(\"Hello, world!\"); } labeled statement A label provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program. For example, you can use a label to identify a loop, and then use the break or continue statements to indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution. The syntax of the labeled statement looks like the following: js label: statement The value of label may be any JavaScript identifier that is not a reserved word. The statement that you identify with a label may be any statement. For examples of using labeled statements, see the examples of break and continue below. break statement Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch , or in conjunction with a labeled statement. When you use break without a label, it terminates the innermost enclosing while , do-while , for , or switch immediately and transfers control to the following statement. When you use break with a label, it terminates the specified labeled statement. The syntax of the break statement looks like this: js break; break label; The first form of the syntax terminates the innermost enclosing loop or switch . The second form of the syntax terminates the specified enclosing labeled statement. Example 1 The following example iterates through the elements in an array until it finds the index of an element whose value is theValue : js for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) { if (a[i] === theValue) { break; } } Example 2: Breaking to a label js let x = 0; let z = 0; labelCancelLoops: while (true) { console.log(\"Outer loops:\", x); x += 1; z = 1; while (true) { console.log(\"Inner loops:\", z); z += 1; if (z === 10 && x === 10) { break labelCancelLoops; } else if (z === 10) { break; } } } continue statement The continue statement can be used to restart a while , do-while , for , or label statement. When you use continue without a label, it terminates the current iteration of the innermost enclosing while , do-while , or for statement and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration. In contrast to the break statement, continue does not terminate the execution of the loop entirely. In a while loop, it jumps back to the condition. In a for loop, it jumps to the increment-expression . When you use continue with a label, it applies to the looping statement identified with that label. The syntax of the continue statement looks like the following: js continue; continue label; Example 1 The following example shows a while loop with a continue statement that executes when the value of i is 3 . Thus, n takes on the values 1 , 3 , 7 , and 12 . js let i = 0; let n = 0; while (i < 5) { i++; if (i === 3) { continue; } n += i; console.log(n); } // Logs: // 1 3 7 12 If you comment out the continue; , the loop would run till the end and you would see 1,3,6,10,15 . Example 2 A statement labeled checkIandJ contains a statement labeled checkJ . If continue is encountered, the program terminates the current iteration of checkJ and begins the next iteration. Each time continue is encountered, checkJ reiterates until its condition returns false . When false is returned, the remainder of the checkIandJ statement is completed, and checkIandJ reiterates until its condition returns false . When false is returned, the program continues at the statement following checkIandJ . If continue had a label of checkIandJ , the program would continue at the top of the checkIandJ statement. js let i = 0; let j = 10; checkIandJ: while (i < 4) { console.log(i); i += 1; checkJ: while (j > 4) { console.log(j); j -= 1; if (j % 2 === 0) { continue; } console.log(j, \"is odd.\"); } console.log(\"i =\", i); console.log(\"j =\", j); } for...in statement The for...in statement iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object. For each distinct property, JavaScript executes the specified statements. A for...in statement looks as follows: js for (variable in object) statement Example The following function takes as its argument an object and the object's name. It then iterates over all the object's properties and returns a string that lists the property names and their values. js function dumpProps(obj, objName) { let result = \"\"; for (const i in obj) { result += `${objName}.${i} = ${obj[i]}<br>`; } result += \"<hr>\"; return result; } For an object car with properties make and model , result would be: car.make = Ford car.model = Mustang Arrays Although it may be tempting to use this as a way to iterate over Array elements, the for...in statement will return the name of your user-defined properties in addition to the numeric indexes. Therefore, it is better to use a traditional for loop with a numeric index when iterating over arrays, because the for...in statement iterates over user-defined properties in addition to the array elements, if you modify the Array object (such as adding custom properties or methods). for...of statement The for...of statement creates a loop Iterating over iterable objects (including Array , Map , Set , arguments object and so on), invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property. js for (variable of iterable) statement The following example shows the difference between a for...of loop and a for...in loop. While for...in iterates over property names, for...of iterates over property values: js const arr = [3, 5, 7]; arr.foo = \"hello\"; for (const i in arr) { console.log(i); } // \"0\" \"1\" \"2\" \"foo\" for (const i of arr) { console.log(i); } // Logs: 3 5 7 The for...of and for...in statements can also be used with destructuring . For example, you can simultaneously loop over the keys and values of an object using Object.entries() . js const obj = { foo: 1, bar: 2 }; for (const [key, val] of Object.entries(obj)) { console.log(key, val); } // \"foo\" 1 // \"bar\" 2 Previous Next Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on Nov 3, 2025 by MDN contributors .

      "text_content": "Working with objects Previous Next JavaScript is designed on an object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties , and a property is an association between a name (or key ) and a value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method . Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to objects in real life. In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. In the same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects. This chapter describes how to use objects, properties, and methods, and how to create your own objects. Creating new objects You can create an object using an object initializer . Alternatively, you can first create a constructor function and then instantiate an object by invoking that function with the new operator. Using object initializers Object initializers are also called object literals . \"Object initializer\" is consistent with the terminology used by C++. The syntax for an object using an object initializer is: js const obj = { property1: value1, // property name may be an identifier 2: value2, // or a number \"property n\": value3, // or a string }; Each property name before colons is an identifier (either a name, a number, or a string literal), and each valueN is an expression whose value is assigned to the property name. The property name can also be an expression; computed keys need to be wrapped in square brackets. The object initializer reference contains a more detailed explanation of the syntax. In this example, the newly created object is assigned to a variable obj â this is optional. If you do not need to refer to this object elsewhere, you do not need to assign it to a variable. (Note that you may need to wrap the object literal in parentheses if the object appears where a statement is expected, so as not to have the literal be confused with a block statement.) Object initializers are expressions, and each object initializer results in a new object being created whenever the statement in which it appears is executed. Identical object initializers create distinct objects that do not compare to each other as equal. The following statement creates an object and assigns it to the variable x if and only if the expression cond is true: js let x; if (cond) { x = { greeting: \"hi there\" }; } The following example creates myHonda with three properties. Note that the engine property is also an object with its own properties. js const myHonda = { color: \"red\", wheels: 4, engine: { cylinders: 4, size: 2.2 }, }; Objects created with initializers are called plain objects , because they are instances of Object , but not any other object type. Some object types have special initializer syntaxes â for example, array initializers and regex literals . Using a constructor function Alternatively, you can create an object with these two steps: Define the object type by writing a constructor function. There is a strong convention, with good reason, to use a capital initial letter. Create an instance of the object with new . To define an object type, create a function for the object type that specifies its name, properties, and methods. For example, suppose you want to create an object type for cars. You want this type of object to be called Car , and you want it to have properties for make, model, and year. To do this, you would write the following function: js function Car(make, model, year) { this.make = make; this.model = model; this.year = year; } Notice the use of this to assign values to the object's properties based on the values passed to the function. Now you can create an object called myCar as follows: js const myCar = new Car(\"Eagle\", \"Talon TSi\", 1993); This statement creates myCar and assigns it the specified values for its properties. Then the value of myCar.make is the string \"Eagle\" , myCar.model is the string \"Talon TSi\" , myCar.year is the integer 1993 , and so on. The order of arguments and parameters should be the same. You can create any number of Car objects by calls to new . For example, js const randCar = new Car(\"Nissan\", \"300ZX\", 1992); const kenCar = new Car(\"Mazda\", \"Miata\", 1990); An object can have a property that is itself another object. For example, suppose you define an object called Person as follows: js function Person(name, age, sex) { this.name = name; this.age = age; this.sex = sex; } and then instantiate two new Person objects as follows: js const rand = new Person(\"Rand McKinnon\", 33, \"M\"); const ken = new Person(\"Ken Jones\", 39, \"M\"); Then, you can rewrite the definition of Car to include an owner property that takes a Person object, as follows: js function Car(make, model, year, owner) { this.make = make; this.model = model; this.year = year; this.owner = owner; } To instantiate the new objects, you then use the following: js const car1 = new Car(\"Eagle\", \"Talon TSi\", 1993, rand); const car2 = new Car(\"Nissan\", \"300ZX\", 1992, ken); Notice that instead of passing a literal string or integer value when creating the new objects, the above statements pass the objects rand and ken as the arguments for the owners. Then if you want to find out the name of the owner of car2 , you can access the following property: js car2.owner.name; You can always add a property to a previously defined object. For example, the statement js car1.color = \"black\"; adds a property color to car1 , and assigns it a value of \"black\" . However, this does not affect any other objects. To add the new property to all objects of the same type, you have to add the property to the definition of the Car object type. You can also use the class syntax instead of the function syntax to define a constructor function. For more information, see the class guide . Using the Object.create() method Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method. This method can be very useful, because it allows you to choose the prototype object for the object you want to create, without having to define a constructor function. js // Animal properties and method encapsulation const animalProto = { type: \"Invertebrates\", // Default value of properties displayType() { // Method which will display the type of animal console.log(this.type); }, }; // Create a new animal type called `animal` const animal = Object.create(animalProto); animal.displayType(); // Logs: Invertebrates // Create a new animal type called fish const fish = Object.create(animalProto); fish.type = \"Fishes\"; fish.displayType(); // Logs: Fishes Objects and properties A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. Object properties are basically the same as variables, except that they are associated with objects, not scopes . The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. For example, this example creates an object named myCar , with properties named make , model , and year , with their values set to \"Ford\" , \"Mustang\" , and 1969 : js const myCar = { make: \"Ford\", model: \"Mustang\", year: 1969, }; Like JavaScript variables, property names are case sensitive. Property names can only be strings or Symbols â all keys are converted to strings unless they are Symbols. Array indices are, in fact, properties with string keys that contain integers. Accessing properties You can access a property of an object by its property name. Property accessors come in two syntaxes: dot notation and bracket notation . For example, you could access the properties of the myCar object as follows: js // Dot notation myCar.make = \"Ford\"; myCar.model = \"Mustang\"; myCar.year = 1969; // Bracket notation myCar[\"make\"] = \"Ford\"; myCar[\"model\"] = \"Mustang\"; myCar[\"year\"] = 1969; An object property name can be any JavaScript string or symbol , including an empty string. However, you cannot use dot notation to access a property whose name is not a valid JavaScript identifier. For example, a property name that has a space or a hyphen, that starts with a number, or that is held inside a variable can only be accessed using the bracket notation. This notation is also very useful when property names are to be dynamically determined, i.e., not determinable until runtime. Examples are as follows: js const myObj = {}; const str = \"myString\"; const rand = Math.random(); const anotherObj = {}; // Create additional properties on myObj myObj.type = \"Dot syntax for a key named type\"; myObj[\"date created\"] = \"This key has a space\"; myObj[str] = \"This key is in variable str\"; myObj[rand] = \"A random number is the key here\"; myObj[anotherObj] = \"This key is object anotherObj\"; myObj[\"\"] = \"This key is an empty string\"; console.log(myObj); // { // type: 'Dot syntax for a key named type', // 'date created': 'This key has a space', // myString: 'This key is in variable str', // '0.6398914448618778': 'A random number is the key here', // '[object Object]': 'This key is object anotherObj', // '': 'This key is an empty string' // } console.log(myObj.myString); // 'This key is in variable str' In the above code, the key anotherObj is an object, which is neither a string nor a symbol. When it is added to the myObj , JavaScript calls the toString() method of anotherObj , and use the resulting string as the new key. You can also access properties with a string value stored in a variable. The variable must be passed in bracket notation. In the example above, the variable str held \"myString\" and it is \"myString\" that is the property name. Therefore, myObj.str will return as undefined. js str = \"myString\"; myObj[str] = \"This key is in variable str\"; console.log(myObj.str); // undefined console.log(myObj[str]); // 'This key is in variable str' console.log(myObj.myString); // 'This key is in variable str' This allows accessing any property as determined at runtime: js let propertyName = \"make\"; myCar[propertyName] = \"Ford\"; // access different properties by changing the contents of the variable propertyName = \"model\"; myCar[propertyName] = \"Mustang\"; console.log(myCar); // { make: 'Ford', model: 'Mustang' } However, beware of using square brackets to access properties whose names are given by external input. This may make your code susceptible to object injection attacks . Nonexistent properties of an object have value undefined (and not null ). js myCar.nonexistentProperty; // undefined Enumerating properties There are three native ways to list/traverse object properties: for...in loops. This method traverses all of the enumerable string properties of an object as well as its prototype chain. Object.keys() . This method returns an array with only the enumerable own string property names (\"keys\") in the object myObj , but not those in the prototype chain. Object.getOwnPropertyNames() . This method returns an array containing all the own string property names in the object myObj , regardless of if they are enumerable or not. You can use the bracket notation with for...in to iterate over all the enumerable properties of an object. To illustrate how this works, the following function displays the properties of the object when you pass the object and the object's name as arguments to the function: js function showProps(obj, objName) { let result = \"\"; for (const i in obj) { // Object.hasOwn() is used to exclude properties from the object's // prototype chain and only show \"own properties\" if (Object.hasOwn(obj, i)) { result += `${objName}.${i} = ${obj[i]}\\n`; } } console.log(result); } The term \"own property\" refers to the properties of the object, but excluding those of the prototype chain. So, the function call showProps(myCar, 'myCar') would print the following: myCar.make = Ford myCar.model = Mustang myCar.year = 1969 The above is equivalent to: js function showProps(obj, objName) { let result = \"\"; Object.keys(obj).forEach((i) => { result += `${objName}.${i} = ${obj[i]}\\n`; }); console.log(result); } There is no native way to list all inherited properties, including non-enumerable ones. However, this can be achieved with the following function: js function listAllProperties(myObj) { let objectToInspect = myObj; let result = []; while (objectToInspect !== null) { result = result.concat(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(objectToInspect)); objectToInspect = Object.getPrototypeOf(objectToInspect); } return result; } For more information, see Enumerability and ownership of properties . Deleting properties You can remove a non-inherited property using the delete operator. The following code shows how to remove a property. js // Creates a new object, myObj, with two properties, a and b. const myObj = { a: 5, b: 12 }; // Removes the a property, leaving myObj with only the b property. delete myObj.a; console.log(\"a\" in myObj); // false Inheritance All objects in JavaScript inherit from at least one other object. The object being inherited from is known as the prototype, and the inherited properties can be found in the prototype object of the constructor. See Inheritance and the prototype chain for more information. Defining properties for all objects of one type You can add a property to all objects created through a certain constructor using the prototype property. This defines a property that is shared by all objects of the specified type, rather than by just one instance of the object. The following code adds a color property to all objects of type Car , and then reads the property's value from an instance car1 . js Car.prototype.color = \"red\"; console.log(car1.color); // \"red\" Defining methods A method is a function associated with an object, or, put differently, a method is a property of an object that is a function. Methods are defined the way normal functions are defined, except that they have to be assigned as the property of an object. See also method definitions for more details. An example is: js objectName.methodName = functionName; const myObj = { myMethod: function (params) { // do something }, // this works too! myOtherMethod(params) { // do something else }, }; where objectName is an existing object, methodName is the name you are assigning to the method, and functionName is the name of the function. You can then call the method in the context of the object as follows: js objectName.methodName(params); Methods are typically defined on the prototype object of the constructor, so that all objects of the same type share the same method. For example, you can define a function that formats and displays the properties of the previously-defined Car objects. js Car.prototype.displayCar = function () { const result = `A Beautiful ${this.year} ${this.make} ${this.model}`; console.log(result); }; Notice the use of this to refer to the object to which the method belongs. Then you can call the displayCar method for each of the objects as follows: js car1.displayCar(); car2.displayCar(); Using this for object references JavaScript has a special keyword, this , that you can use within a method to refer to the current object. For example, suppose you have 2 objects, manager and intern . Each object has its own name , age and job . In the function sayHi() , notice the use of this.name . When added to the 2 objects, the same function will print the message with the name of the respective object it's attached to. js const manager = { name: \"Karina\", age: 27, job: \"Software Engineer\", }; const intern = { name: \"Tyrone\", age: 21, job: \"Software Engineer Intern\", }; function sayHi() { console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`); } // Add sayHi function to both objects manager.sayHi = sayHi; intern.sayHi = sayHi; manager.sayHi(); // Hello, my name is Karina intern.sayHi(); // Hello, my name is Tyrone this is a \"hidden parameter\" of a function call that's passed in by specifying the object before the function that was called. For example, in manager.sayHi() , this is the manager object, because manager comes before the function sayHi() . If you access the same function from another object, this will change as well. If you use other methods to call the function, like Function.prototype.call() or Reflect.apply() , you can explicitly pass the value of this as an argument. Defining getters and setters A getter is a function associated with a property that gets the value of a specific property. A setter is a function associated with a property that sets the value of a specific property. Together, they can indirectly represent the value of a property. Getters and setters can be either defined within object initializers , or added later to any existing object. Within object initializers , getters and setters are defined like regular methods , but prefixed with the keywords get or set . The getter method must not expect a parameter, while the setter method expects exactly one parameter (the new value to set). For instance: js const myObj = { a: 7, get b() { return this.a + 1; }, set c(x) { this.a = x / 2; }, }; console.log(myObj.a); // 7 console.log(myObj.b); // 8, returned from the get b() method myObj.c = 50; // Calls the set c(x) method console.log(myObj.a); // 25 The myObj object's properties are: myObj.a â a number myObj.b â a getter that returns myObj.a plus 1 myObj.c â a setter that sets the value of myObj.a to half of the value myObj.c is being set to Getters and setters can also be added to an object at any time after creation using the Object.defineProperties() method. This method's first parameter is the object on which you want to define the getter or setter. The second parameter is an object whose property names are the getter or setter names, and whose property values are objects for defining the getter or setter functions. Here's an example that defines the same getter and setter used in the previous example: js const myObj = { a: 0 }; Object.defineProperties(myObj, { b: { get() { return this.a + 1; }, }, c: { set(x) { this.a = x / 2; }, }, }); myObj.c = 10; // Runs the setter, which assigns 10 / 2 (5) to the 'a' property console.log(myObj.b); // Runs the getter, which yields a + 1 or 6 Which of the two forms to choose depends on your programming style and task at hand. If you can change the definition of the original object, you will probably define getters and setters through the original initializer. This form is more compact and natural. However, if you need to add getters and setters later â maybe because you did not write the particular object â then the second form is the only possible form. The second form better represents the dynamic nature of JavaScript, but it can make the code hard to read and understand. Comparing objects In JavaScript, objects are a reference type. Two distinct objects are never equal, even if they have the same properties. Only comparing the same object reference with itself yields true. js // Two variables, two distinct objects with the same properties const fruit = { name: \"apple\" }; const anotherFruit = { name: \"apple\" }; fruit == anotherFruit; // return false fruit === anotherFruit; // return false js // Two variables, a single object const fruit = { name: \"apple\" }; const anotherFruit = fruit; // Assign fruit object reference to anotherFruit // Here fruit and anotherFruit are pointing to same object fruit == anotherFruit; // return true fruit === anotherFruit; // return true fruit.name = \"grape\"; console.log(anotherFruit); // { name: \"grape\" }; not { name: \"apple\" } For more information about comparison operators, see equality operators .

However, with the addition of classes , the creation of hierarchies of objects and the inheritance of properties and their values are much more in line with other object-oriented languages such as Java. In this section, we will demonstrate how objects can be created from classes. In many other languages, classes , or constructors, are clearly distinguished from objects , or instances. In JavaScript, classes are mainly an abstraction over the existing prototypical inheritance mechanism â all patterns are convertible to prototype-based inheritance. Classes themselves are normal JavaScript values as well, and have their own prototype chains. In fact, most plain JavaScript functions can be used as constructors â you use the new operator with a constructor function to create a new object. We will be playing with the well-abstracted class model in this tutorial, and discuss what semantics classes offer. If you want to dive deep into the underlying prototype system, you can read the Inheritance and the prototype chain guide. This chapter assumes that you are already somewhat familiar with JavaScript and that you have used ordinary objects. Overview of classes If you have some hands-on experience with JavaScript, or have followed along with the guide, you probably have already used classes, even if you haven't created one. For example, this may seem familiar to you : js const bigDay = new Date(2019, 6, 19); console.log(bigDay.toLocaleDateString()); if (bigDay.getTime() < Date.now()) { console.log(\"Once upon a time...\"); } On the first line, we created an instance of the class Date , and called it bigDay . On the second line, we called a method toLocaleDateString() on the bigDay instance, which returns a string. Then, we compared two numbers: one returned from the getTime() method, the other directly called from the Date class itself , as Date.now() . Date is a built-in class of JavaScript. From this example, we can get some basic ideas of what classes do: Classes create objects through the new operator. Each object has some properties (data or method) added by the class. The class stores some properties (data or method) itself, which are usually used to interact with instances. These correspond to the three key features of classes: Constructor; Instance methods and instance fields; Static methods and static fields. Declaring a class Classes are usually created with class declarations . js class MyClass { // class body... } Within a class body, there are a range of features available. js class MyClass { // Constructor constructor() { // Constructor body } // Instance field myField = \"foo\"; // Instance method myMethod() { // myMethod body } // Static field static myStaticField = \"bar\"; // Static method static myStaticMethod() { // myStaticMethod body } // Static block static { // Static initialization code } // Fields, methods, static fields, and static methods all have // \"private\" forms #myPrivateField = \"bar\"; } If you came from a pre-ES6 world, you may be more familiar with using functions as constructors. The pattern above would roughly translate to the following with function constructors: js function MyClass() { this.myField = \"foo\"; // Constructor body } MyClass.myStaticField = \"bar\"; MyClass.myStaticMethod = function () { // myStaticMethod body }; MyClass.prototype.myMethod = function () { // myMethod body }; (function () { // Static initialization code })(); Note: Private fields and methods are new features in classes with no trivial equivalent in function constructors. Constructing a class After a class has been declared, you can create instances of it using the new operator. js const myInstance = new MyClass(); console.log(myInstance.myField); // 'foo' myInstance.myMethod(); Typical function constructors can both be constructed with new and called without new . However, attempting to \"call\" a class without new will result in an error. js const myInstance = MyClass(); // TypeError: Class constructor MyClass cannot be invoked without 'new' Class declaration hoisting Unlike function declarations, class declarations are not hoisted (or, in some interpretations, hoisted but with the temporal dead zone restriction), which means you cannot use a class before it is declared. js new MyClass(); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'MyClass' before initialization class MyClass {} This behavior is similar to variables declared with let and const . Class expressions Similar to functions, class declarations also have their expression counterparts. js const MyClass = class { // Class body... }; Class expressions can have names as well. The expression's name is only visible to the class's body. js const MyClass = class MyClassLongerName { // Class body. Here MyClass and MyClassLongerName point to the same class. }; new MyClassLongerName(); // ReferenceError: MyClassLongerName is not defined Constructor Perhaps the most important job of a class is to act as a \"factory\" for objects. For example, when we use the Date constructor, we expect it to give a new object which represents the date data we passed in â which we can then manipulate with other methods the instance exposes. In classes, the instance creation is done by the constructor . As an example, we would create a class called Color , which represents a specific color. Users create colors through passing in an RGB triplet. js class Color { constructor(r, g, b) { // Assign the RGB values as a property of `this`. this.values = [r, g, b]; } } Open your browser's devtools, paste the above code into the console, and then create an instance: js const red = new Color(255, 0, 0); console.log(red); You should see some output like this: Object { values: (3) [â¦] } values: Array(3) [ 255, 0, 0 ] You have successfully created a Color instance, and the instance has a values property, which is an array of the RGB values you passed in. That is pretty much equivalent to the following: js function createColor(r, g, b) { return { values: [r, g, b], }; } The constructor's syntax is exactly the same as a normal function â which means you can use other syntaxes, like rest parameters : js class Color { constructor(...values) { this.values = values; } } const red = new Color(255, 0, 0); // Creates an instance with the same shape as above. Each time you call new , a different instance is created. js const red = new Color(255, 0, 0); const anotherRed = new Color(255, 0, 0); console.log(red === anotherRed); // false Within a class constructor, the value of this points to the newly created instance. You can assign properties to it, or read existing properties (especially methods â which we will cover next). The this value will be automatically returned as the result of new . You are advised to not return any value from the constructor â because if you return a non-primitive value, it will become the value of the new expression, and the value of this is dropped. (You can read more about what new does in its description .) js class MyClass { constructor() { this.myField = \"foo\"; return {}; } } console.log(new MyClass().myField); // undefined Instance methods If a class only has a constructor, it is not much different from a createX factory function which just creates plain objects. However, the power of classes is that they can be used as \"templates\" which automatically assign methods to instances. For example, for Date instances, you can use a range of methods to get different information from a single date value, such as the year , month , day of the week , etc. You can also set those values through the setX counterparts like setFullYear . For our own Color class, we can add a method called getRed which returns the red value of the color. js class Color { constructor(r, g, b) { this.values = [r, g, b]; } getRed() { return this.values[0]; } } const red = new Color(255, 0, 0); console.log(red.getRed()); // 255 Without methods, you may be tempted to define the function within the constructor: js class Color { constructor(r, g, b) { this.values = [r, g, b]; this.getRed = function () { return this.values[0]; }; } } This also works. However, a problem is that this creates a new function every time a Color instance is created, even when they all do the same thing! js console.log(new Color().getRed === new Color().getRed); // false In contrast, if you use a method, it will be shared between all instances. A function can be shared between all instances, but still have its behavior differ when different instances call it, because the value of this is different. If you are curious where this method is stored in â it's defined on the prototype of all instances, or Color.prototype , which is explained in more detail in Inheritance and the prototype chain . Similarly, we can create a new method called setRed , which sets the red value of the color. js class Color { constructor(r, g, b) { this.values = [r, g, b]; } getRed() { return this.values[0]; } setRed(value) { this.values[0] = value; } } const red = new Color(255, 0, 0); red.setRed(0); console.log(red.getRed()); // 0; of course, it should be called \"black\" at this stage! Private fields You might be wondering: why do we want to go to the trouble of using getRed and setRed methods, when we can directly access the values array on the instance? js class Color { constructor(r, g, b) { this.values = [r, g, b]; } } const red = new Color(255, 0, 0); red.values[0] = 0; console.log(red.values[0]); // 0 There is a philosophy in object-oriented programming called \"encapsulation\". This means you should not access the underlying implementation of an object, but instead use well-abstracted methods to interact with it. For example, if we suddenly decided to represent colors as HSL instead: js class Color { constructor(r, g, b) { // values is now an HSL array! this.values = rgbToHSL([r, g, b]); } getRed() { return hslToRGB(this.values)[0]; } setRed(value) { const rgb = hslToRGB(this.values); rgb[0] = value; this.values = rgbToHSL(rgb); } } const red = new Color(255, 0, 0); console.log(red.values[0]); // 0; It's not 255 anymore, because the H value for pure red is 0 The user assumption that values means the RGB value suddenly collapses, and it may cause their logic to break. So, if you are an implementor of a class, you would want to hide the internal data structure of your instance from your user, both to keep the API clean and to prevent the user's code from breaking when you do some \"harmless refactors\". In classes, this is done through private fields . A private field is an identifier prefixed with # (the hash symbol). The hash is an integral part of the field's name, which means a private field can never have name clash with a public field or method. In order to refer to a private field anywhere in the class, you must declare it in the class body (you can't create a private element on the fly). Apart from this, a private field is pretty much equivalent to a normal property. js class Color { // Declare: every Color instance has a private field called #values. #values; constructor(r, g, b) { this.#values = [r, g, b]; } getRed() { return this.#values[0]; } setRed(value) { this.#values[0] = value; } } const red = new Color(255, 0, 0); console.log(red.getRed()); // 255 Accessing private fields outside the class is an early syntax error. The language can guard against this because #privateField is a special syntax, so it can do some static analysis and find all usage of private fields before even evaluating the code. js console.log(red.#values); // SyntaxError: Private field '#values' must be declared in an enclosing class Note: Code run in the Chrome console can access private elements outside the class. This is a DevTools-only relaxation of the JavaScript syntax restriction. Private fields in JavaScript are hard private : if the class does not implement methods that expose these private fields, there's absolutely no mechanism to retrieve them from outside the class. This means you are safe to do any refactors to your class's private fields, as long as the behavior of exposed methods stay the same. After we've made the values field private, we can add some more logic in the getRed and setRed methods, instead of making them simple pass-through methods. For example, we can add a check in setRed to see if it's a valid R value: js class Color { #values; constructor(r, g, b) { this.#values = [r, g, b]; } getRed() { return this.#values[0]; } setRed(value) { if (value < 0 || value > 255) { throw new RangeError(\"Invalid R value\"); } this.#values[0] = value; } } const red = new Color(255, 0, 0); red.setRed(1000); // RangeError: Invalid R value If we leave the values property exposed, our users can easily circumvent that check by assigning to values[0] directly, and create invalid colors. But with a well-encapsulated API, we can make our code more robust and prevent logic errors downstream. A class method can read the private fields of other instances, as long as they belong to the same class. js class Color { #values; constructor(r, g, b) { this.#values = [r, g, b]; } redDifference(anotherColor) { // #values doesn't necessarily need to be accessed from this: // you can access private fields of other instances belonging // to the same class. return this.#values[0] - anotherColor.#values[0]; } } const red = new Color(255, 0, 0); const crimson = new Color(220, 20, 60); red.redDifference(crimson); // 35 However, if anotherColor is not a Color instance, #values won't exist. (Even if another class has an identically named #values private field, it's not referring to the same thing and cannot be accessed here.) Accessing a nonexistent private element throws an error instead of returning undefined like normal properties do. If you don't know if a private field exists on an object and you wish to access it without using try / catch to handle the error, you can use the in operator. js class Color { #values; constructor(r, g, b) { this.#values = [r, g, b]; } redDifference(anotherColor) { if (!(#values in anotherColor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Color instance expected\"); } return this.#values[0] - anotherColor.#values[0]; } } Note: Keep in mind that the # is a special identifier syntax, and you can't use the field name as if it's a string. \"#values\" in anotherColor would look for a property name literally called \"#values\" , instead of a private field. There are some limitations in using private elements: the same name can't be declared twice in a single class, and they can't be deleted. Both lead to early syntax errors. js class BadIdeas { #firstName; #firstName; // syntax error occurs here #lastName; constructor() { delete this.#lastName; // also a syntax error } } Methods, getters, and setters can be private as well. They're useful when you have something complex that the class needs to do internally but no other part of the code should be allowed to call. For example, imagine creating HTML custom elements that should do something somewhat complicated when clicked/tapped/otherwise activated. Furthermore, the somewhat complicated things that happen when the element is clicked should be restricted to this class, because no other part of the JavaScript will (or should) ever access it. js class Counter extends HTMLElement { #xValue = 0; constructor() { super(); this.onclick = this.#clicked.bind(this); } get #x() { return this.#xValue; } set #x(value) { this.#xValue = value; window.requestAnimationFrame(this.#render.bind(this)); } #clicked() { this.#x++; } #render() { this.textContent = this.#x.toString(); } connectedCallback() { this.#render(); } } customElements.define(\"num-counter\", Counter); In this case, pretty much every field and method is private to the class. Thus, it presents an interface to the rest of the code that's essentially just like a built-in HTML element. No other part of the program has the power to affect any of the internals of Counter . Accessor fields color.getRed() and color.setRed() allow us to read and write to the red value of a color. If you come from languages like Java, you will be very familiar with this pattern. However, using methods to simply access a property is still somewhat unergonomic in JavaScript. Accessor fields allow us to manipulate something as if it is an \"actual property\". js class Color { constructor(r, g, b) { this.values = [r, g, b]; } get red() { return this.values[0]; } set red(value) { this.values[0] = value; } } const red = new Color(255, 0, 0); red.red = 0; console.log(red.red); // 0 It looks as if the object has a property called red â but actually, no such property exists on the instance! There are only two methods, but they are prefixed with get and set , which allows them to be manipulated as if they were properties. If a field only has a getter but no setter, it will be effectively read-only. js class Color { constructor(r, g, b) { this.values = [r, g, b]; } get red() { return this.values[0]; } } const red = new Color(255, 0, 0); red.red = 0; console.log(red.red); // 255 In strict mode , the red.red = 0 line will throw a type error: \"Cannot set property red of #<Color> which has only a getter\". In non-strict mode, the assignment is silently ignored. Public fields Private fields also have their public counterparts, which allow every instance to have a property. Fields are usually designed to be independent of the constructor's parameters. js class MyClass { luckyNumber = Math.random(); } console.log(new MyClass().luckyNumber); // 0.5 console.log(new MyClass().luckyNumber); // 0.3 Public fields are almost equivalent to assigning a property to this . For example, the above example can also be converted to: js class MyClass { constructor() { this.luckyNumber = Math.random(); } } Static properties With the Date example, we have also encountered the Date.now() method, which returns the current date. This method does not belong to any date instance â it belongs to the class itself. However, it's put on the Date class instead of being exposed as a global DateNow() function, because it's mostly useful when dealing with date instances. Note: Prefixing utility methods with what they deal with is called \"namespacing\" and is considered a good practice. For example, in addition to the older, unprefixed parseInt() method, JavaScript also later added the prefixed Number.parseInt() method to indicate that it's for dealing with numbers. Static properties are a group of class features that are defined on the class itself, rather than on individual instances of the class. These features include: Static methods Static fields Static getters and setters Everything also has private counterparts. For example, for our Color class, we can create a static method that checks whether a given triplet is a valid RGB value: js class Color { static isValid(r, g, b) { return r >= 0 && r <= 255 && g >= 0 && g <= 255 && b >= 0 && b <= 255; } } Color.isValid(255, 0, 0); // true Color.isValid(1000, 0, 0); // false Static properties are very similar to their instance counterparts, except that: They are all prefixed with static , and They are not accessible from instances. js console.log(new Color(0, 0, 0).isValid); // undefined There is also a special construct called a static initialization block , which is a block of code that runs when the class is first loaded. js class MyClass { static { MyClass.myStaticProperty = \"foo\"; } } console.log(MyClass.myStaticProperty); // 'foo' Static initialization blocks are almost equivalent to immediately executing some code after a class has been declared. The only difference is that they have access to static private elements. Extends and inheritance A key feature that classes bring about (in addition to ergonomic encapsulation with private fields) is inheritance , which means one object can \"borrow\" a large part of another object's behaviors, while overriding or enhancing certain parts with its own logic. For example, suppose our Color class now needs to support transparency. We may be tempted to add a new field that indicates its transparency: js class Color { #values; constructor(r, g, b, a = 1) { this.#values = [r, g, b, a]; } get alpha() { return this.#values[3]; } set alpha(value) { if (value < 0 || value > 1) { throw new RangeError(\"Alpha value must be between 0 and 1\"); } this.#values[3] = value; } } However, this means every instance â even the vast majority which aren't transparent (those with an alpha value of 1) â will have to have the extra alpha value, which is not very elegant. Plus, if the features keep growing, our Color class will become very bloated and hard to maintain. Instead, in object-oriented programming, we would create a derived class . The derived class has access to all public properties of the parent class. In JavaScript, derived classes are declared with an extends clause, which indicates the class it extends from. js class ColorWithAlpha extends Color { #alpha; constructor(r, g, b, a) { super(r, g, b); this.#alpha = a; } get alpha() { return this.#alpha; } set alpha(value) { if (value < 0 || value > 1) { throw new RangeError(\"Alpha value must be between 0 and 1\"); } this.#alpha = value; } } There are a few things that have immediately come to attention. First is that in the constructor, we are calling super(r, g, b) . It is a language requirement to call super() before accessing this . The super() call calls the parent class's constructor to initialize this â here it's roughly equivalent to this = new Color(r, g, b) . You can have code before super() , but you cannot access this before super() â the language prevents you from accessing the uninitialized this . After the parent class is done with modifying this , the derived class can do its own logic. Here we added a private field called #alpha , and also provided a pair of getter/setters to interact with them. A derived class inherits all methods from its parent. For example, consider the get red() accessor we added to the Color in the Accessor fields sectionâeven though we haven't declared one in ColorWithAlpha , we can still access red because this behavior is specified by the parent class: js const color = new ColorWithAlpha(255, 0, 0, 0.5); console.log(color.red); // 255 Derived classes can also override methods from the parent class. For example, all classes implicitly inherit the Object class, which defines some basic methods like toString() . However, the base toString() method is notoriously useless, because it prints [object Object] in most cases: js console.log(red.toString()); // [object Object] Instead, our class can override it to print the color's RGB values: js class Color { #values; // â¦ toString() { return this.#values.join(\", \"); } } console.log(new Color(255, 0, 0).toString()); // '255, 0, 0' Within derived classes, you can access the parent class's methods by using super . This allows you to build enhancement methods and avoid code duplication. js class ColorWithAlpha extends Color { #alpha; // â¦ toString() { // Call the parent class's toString() and build on the return value return `${super.toString()}, ${this.#alpha}`; } } console.log(new ColorWithAlpha(255, 0, 0, 0.5).toString()); // '255, 0, 0, 0.5' When you use extends , the static methods inherit from each other as well, so you can also override or enhance them. js class ColorWithAlpha extends Color { // â¦ static isValid(r, g, b, a) { // Call the parent class's isValid() and build on the return value return super.isValid(r, g, b) && a >= 0 && a <= 1; } } console.log(ColorWithAlpha.isValid(255, 0, 0, -1)); // false Derived classes don't have access to the parent class's private fields â this is another key aspect to JavaScript private fields being \"hard private\". Private fields are scoped to the class body itself and do not grant access to any outside code. js class ColorWithAlpha extends Color { log() { console.log(this.#values); // SyntaxError: Private field '#values' must be declared in an enclosing class } } A class can only extend from one class. This prevents problems in multiple inheritance like the diamond problem . However, due to the dynamic nature of JavaScript, it's still possible to achieve the effect of multiple inheritance through class composition and mixins . Instances of derived classes are also instances of the base class. js const color = new ColorWithAlpha(255, 0, 0, 0.5); console.log(color instanceof Color); // true console.log(color instanceof ColorWithAlpha); // true Why classes? The guide has been pragmatic so far: we are focusing on how classes can be used, but there's one question unanswered: why would one use a class? The answer is: it depends. Classes introduce a paradigm , or a way to organize your code. Classes are the foundations of object-oriented programming, which is built on concepts like inheritance and polymorphism (especially subtype polymorphism ). However, many people are philosophically against certain OOP practices and don't use classes as a result. For example, one thing that makes Date objects infamous is that they're mutable . js function incrementDay(date) { return new Date(date.setDate(date.getDate() + 1)); } const date = new Date(); // 2019-06-19 const newDay = incrementDay(date); console.log(newDay); // 2019-06-20 // The old date is modified as well!? console.log(date); // 2019-06-20 Mutability and internal state are important aspects of object-oriented programming, but often make code hard to reason with â because any seemingly innocent operation may have unexpected side effects and change the behavior in other parts of the program. In order to reuse code, we usually resort to extending classes, which can create big hierarchies of inheritance patterns. However, it is often hard to describe inheritance cleanly when one class can only extend one other class. Often, we want the behavior of multiple classes. In Java, this is done through interfaces; in JavaScript, it can be done through mixins. But at the end of the day, it's still not very convenient. On the brighter side, classes are a very powerful way to organize our code on a higher level. For example, without the Color class, we may need to create a dozen of utility functions: js function isRed(color) { return color.red === 255; } function isValidColor(color) { return ( color.red >= 0 && color.red <= 255 && color.green >= 0 && color.green <= 255 && color.blue >= 0 && color.blue <= 255 ); } // â¦ But with classes, we can congregate them all under the Color namespace, which improves readability. In addition, the introduction of private fields allows us to hide certain data from downstream users, creating a clean API. In general, you should consider using classes when you want to create objects that store their own internal data and expose a lot of behavior. Take built-in JavaScript classes as examples: The Map and Set classes store a collection of elements and allow you to access them by key using get() , set() , has() , etc. The Date class stores a date as a Unix timestamp (a number) and allows you to format, update, and read individual date components. The Error class stores information about a particular exception, including the error message, stack trace, cause, etc. It's one of the few classes that come with a rich inheritance structure: there are multiple built-in classes like TypeError and ReferenceError that extend Error . In the case of errors, this inheritance allows refining the semantics of errors: each error class represents a specific type of error, which can be easily checked with instanceof . JavaScript offers the mechanism to organize your code in a canonical object-oriented way, but whether and how to use it is entirely up to the programmer's discretion.

Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback Warning: The argument passed to this function is dynamically parsed and executed as JavaScript. APIs like this are known as injection sinks , and are potentially a vector for cross-site-scripting (XSS) attacks. You can mitigate this risk by always passing TrustedScript objects instead of strings and enforcing trusted types . See Security considerations for more information. The eval() function evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string and returns its completion value. The source is parsed as a script. Try it console.log(eval(\"2 + 2\")); // Expected output: 4 console.log(eval(new String(\"2 + 2\"))); // Expected output: 2 + 2 console.log(eval(\"2 + 2\") === eval(\"4\")); // Expected output: true console.log(eval(\"2 + 2\") === eval(new String(\"2 + 2\"))); // Expected output: false Syntax js eval(script) Parameters script A TrustedScript instance or string representing a JavaScript expression, statement, or sequence of statements. The expression can include variables and properties of existing objects. It will be parsed as a script, so import declarations (which can only exist in modules) are not allowed. Return value The completion value of evaluating the given code. If the completion value is empty, undefined is returned. If script is not a TrustedScript or string primitive, eval() returns the argument unchanged. Exceptions SyntaxError The script parameter cannot be parsed as a script. TypeError script is a string when Trusted Types are enforced by a CSP and no default policy is defined. The method also throws any exception that occurs during evaluation of the code. Description eval() is a function property of the global object. The argument of the eval() function is a string. It will evaluate the source string as a script body, which means both statements and expressions are allowed. It returns the completion value of the code. For expressions, it's the value the expression evaluates to. Many statements and declarations have completion values as well, but the result may be surprising (for example, the completion value of an assignment is the assigned value, but the completion value of let is undefined), so it's recommended to not rely on statements' completion values. In strict mode, declaring a variable named eval or re-assigning eval is a SyntaxError . js \"use strict\"; const eval = 1; // SyntaxError: Unexpected eval or arguments in strict mode If the argument of eval() is not a TrustedScript or string, eval() returns the argument unchanged. In the following example, passing a String object instead of a primitive causes eval() to return the String object rather than evaluating the string. js eval(new String(\"2 + 2\")); // returns a String object containing \"2 + 2\" eval(\"2 + 2\"); // returns 4 To work around the issue in a generic fashion, you can coerce the argument to a string yourself before passing it to eval() . js const expression = new String(\"2 + 2\"); eval(String(expression)); // returns 4 Direct and indirect eval There are two modes of eval() calls: direct eval and indirect eval. Direct eval, as the name implies, refers to directly calling the global eval function with eval(...) . Everything else, including invoking it via an aliased variable, via a member access or other expression, or through the optional chaining ?. operator, is indirect. js // Direct call eval(\"x + y\"); // Indirect call using the comma operator to return eval (0, eval)(\"x + y\"); // Indirect call through optional chaining eval?.(\"x + y\"); // Indirect call using a variable to store and return eval const myEval = eval; myEval(\"x + y\"); // Indirect call through member access const obj = { eval }; obj.eval(\"x + y\"); Indirect eval can be seen as if the code is evaluated within a separate <script> tag. This means: Indirect eval works in the global scope rather than the local scope, and the code being evaluated doesn't have access to local variables within the scope where it's being called. js function test() { const x = 2; const y = 4; // Direct call, uses local scope console.log(eval(\"x + y\")); // Result is 6 // Indirect call, uses global scope console.log(eval?.(\"x + y\")); // Throws because x is not defined in global scope } Indirect eval does not inherit the strictness of the surrounding context, and is only in strict mode if the source string itself has a \"use strict\" directive. js function nonStrictContext() { eval?.(`with (Math) console.log(PI);`); } function strictContext() { \"use strict\"; eval?.(`with (Math) console.log(PI);`); } function strictContextStrictEval() { \"use strict\"; eval?.(`\"use strict\"; with (Math) console.log(PI);`); } nonStrictContext(); // Logs 3.141592653589793 strictContext(); // Logs 3.141592653589793 strictContextStrictEval(); // Uncaught SyntaxError: Strict mode code may not include a with statement On the other hand, direct eval inherits the strictness of the invoking context. js function nonStrictContext() { eval(`with (Math) console.log(PI);`); } function strictContext() { \"use strict\"; eval(`with (Math) console.log(PI);`); } function strictContextStrictEval() { \"use strict\"; eval(`\"use strict\"; with (Math) console.log(PI);`); } nonStrictContext(); // Logs 3.141592653589793 strictContext(); // Uncaught SyntaxError: Strict mode code may not include a with statement strictContextStrictEval(); // Uncaught SyntaxError: Strict mode code may not include a with statement var -declared variables and function declarations would go into the surrounding scope if the source string is not interpreted in strict mode â for indirect eval, they become global variables. If it's a direct eval in a strict mode context, or if the eval source string itself is in strict mode, then var and function declarations do not \"leak\" into the surrounding scope. js // Neither context nor source string is strict, // so var creates a variable in the surrounding scope eval(\"var a = 1;\"); console.log(a); // 1 // Context is not strict, but eval source is strict, // so b is scoped to the evaluated script eval(\"'use strict'; var b = 1;\"); console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined function strictContext() { \"use strict\"; // Context is strict, but this is indirect and the source // string is not strict, so c is still global eval?.(\"var c = 1;\"); // Direct eval in a strict context, so d is scoped eval(\"var d = 1;\"); } strictContext(); console.log(c); // 1 console.log(d); // ReferenceError: d is not defined let and const declarations within the evaluated string are always scoped to that script. Direct eval may have access to additional contextual expressions. For example, in a function's body, one can use new.target : js function Ctor() { eval(\"console.log(new.target)\"); } new Ctor(); // [Function: Ctor] Never use direct eval()! Using direct eval() suffers from multiple problems: eval() executes the code it's passed with the privileges of the caller. If you run eval() with a string that could be affected by a malicious party, you may end up running malicious code on the user's machine with the permissions of your webpage / extension. More importantly, allowing third-party code to access the scope in which eval() was invoked (if it's a direct eval) can lead to possible attacks that reads or changes local variables. See Security considerations for approaches that mitigate these risks. eval() is slower than the alternatives, since it has to invoke the JavaScript interpreter, while many other constructs are optimized by modern JS engines. Modern JavaScript interpreters convert JavaScript to machine code. This means that any concept of variable naming gets obliterated. Thus, any use of eval() will force the browser to do long expensive variable name lookups to figure out where the variable exists in the machine code and set its value. Additionally, new things can be introduced to that variable through eval() , such as changing the type of that variable, forcing the browser to re-evaluate all of the generated machine code to compensate. Minifiers give up on any minification if the scope is transitively depended on by eval() , because otherwise eval() cannot read the correct variable at runtime. There are many cases where the use of eval() or related methods can be optimized or avoided altogether. Using indirect eval() Consider this code: js function looseJsonParse(obj) { return eval(`(${obj})`); } console.log(looseJsonParse(\"{ a: 4 - 1, b: function () {}, c: new Map() }\")); Simply using indirect eval and forcing strict mode can make the code much better: js function looseJsonParse(obj) { return eval?.(`\"use strict\";(${obj})`); } console.log(looseJsonParse(\"{ a: 4 - 1, b: function () {}, c: new Map() }\")); The two code snippets above may seem to work the same way, but they do not; the first one using direct eval suffers from multiple problems. It is a great deal slower, due to more scope inspections. Notice c: new Map() in the evaluated string. In the indirect eval version, the object is being evaluated in the global scope, so it is safe for the interpreter to assume that Map refers to the global Map() constructor instead of a local variable called Map . However, in the code using direct eval, the interpreter cannot assume this. For example, in the following code, Map in the evaluated string doesn't refer to window.Map() . js function looseJsonParse(obj) { class Map {} return eval(`(${obj})`); } console.log(looseJsonParse(`{ a: 4 - 1, b: function () {}, c: new Map() }`)); Thus, in the eval() version of the code, the browser is forced to make the expensive lookup call to check to see if there are any local variables called Map() . If not using strict mode, var declarations within the eval() source becomes variables in the surrounding scope. This leads to hard-to-debug issues if the string is acquired from external input, especially if there's an existing variable with the same name. Direct eval can read and mutate bindings in the surrounding scope, which may lead to external input corrupting local data. When using direct eval , especially when the eval source cannot be proven to be in strict mode, the engine â and build tools â have to disable all optimizations related to inlining, because the eval() source can depend on any variable name in its surrounding scope. However, using indirect eval() does not allow passing extra bindings other than existing global variables for the evaluated source to read. If you need to specify additional variables that the evaluated source should have access to, consider using the Function() constructor. Using the Function() constructor The Function() constructor is very similar to the indirect eval example above: it also evaluates the JavaScript source passed to it in the global scope without reading or mutating any local bindings, and therefore allows engines to do more optimizations than direct eval() . The difference between eval() and Function() is that the source string passed to Function() is parsed as a function body, not as a script. There are a few nuances â for example, you can use return statements at the top level of a function body, but not in a script. The Function() constructor is useful if you wish to create local bindings within your eval source, by passing the variables as parameter bindings. js function add(a, b) { return a + b; } function runCodeWithAddFunction(obj) { return Function(\"add\", `\"use strict\";return (${obj});`)(add); } console.log(runCodeWithAddFunction(\"add(5, 7)\")); // 12 Both eval() and Function() implicitly evaluate arbitrary code, and are forbidden in strict CSP settings. There are also additional safer (and faster!) alternatives to eval() or Function() for common use-cases. Using bracket accessors You should not use eval() to access properties dynamically. Consider the following example where the property of the object to be accessed is not known until the code is executed. This can be done with eval() : js const obj = { a: 20, b: 30 }; const propName = getPropName(); // returns \"a\" or \"b\" const result = eval(`obj.${propName}`); However, eval() is not necessary here â in fact, it's more error-prone, because if propName is not a valid identifier, it leads to a syntax error. Moreover, if getPropName is not a function you control, this may lead to execution of arbitrary code. Instead, use the property accessors , which are much faster and safer: js const obj = { a: 20, b: 30 }; const propName = getPropName(); // returns \"a\" or \"b\" const result = obj[propName]; // obj[\"a\"] is the same as obj.a You can even use this method to access descendant properties. Using eval() , this would look like: js const obj = { a: { b: { c: 0 } } }; const propPath = getPropPath(); // suppose it returns \"a.b.c\" const result = eval(`obj.${propPath}`); // 0 Avoiding eval() here could be done by splitting the property path and looping through the different properties: js function getDescendantProp(obj, desc) { const arr = desc.split(\".\"); while (arr.length) { obj = obj[arr.shift()]; } return obj; } const obj = { a: { b: { c: 0 } } }; const propPath = getPropPath(); // suppose it returns \"a.b.c\" const result = getDescendantProp(obj, propPath); // 0 Setting a property that way works similarly: js function setDescendantProp(obj, desc, value) { const arr = desc.split(\".\"); while (arr.length > 1) { obj = obj[arr.shift()]; } return (obj[arr[0]] = value); } const obj = { a: { b: { c: 0 } } }; const propPath = getPropPath(); // suppose it returns \"a.b.c\" const result = setDescendantProp(obj, propPath, 1); // obj.a.b.c is now 1 However, beware that using bracket accessors with unconstrained input is not safe either â it may lead to object injection attacks . Using callbacks JavaScript has first-class functions , which means you can pass functions as arguments to other APIs, store them in variables and objects' properties, and so on. Many DOM APIs are designed with this in mind, so you can (and should) write: js // Instead of setTimeout(\"â¦\", 1000) use: setTimeout(() => { // â¦ }, 1000); // Instead of elt.setAttribute(\"onclick\", \"â¦\") use: elt.addEventListener(\"click\", () => { // â¦ }); Closures are also helpful as a way to create parameterized functions without concatenating strings. Using JSON If the string you're calling eval() on contains data (for example, an array: \"[1, 2, 3]\" ), as opposed to code, you should consider switching to JSON , which allows the string to use a subset of JavaScript syntax to represent data. Note that since JSON syntax is limited compared to JavaScript syntax, many valid JavaScript literals will not parse as JSON. For example, trailing commas are not allowed in JSON, and property names (keys) in object literals must be enclosed in quotes. Be sure to use a JSON serializer to generate strings that will be later parsed as JSON. Passing carefully constrained data instead of arbitrary code is a good idea in general. For example, an extension designed to scrape contents of web-pages could have the scraping rules defined in XPath instead of JavaScript code. Security considerations The method can be used to execute arbitrary input with the privileges of the caller. If the input is a potentially unsafe string provided by a user, this is a possible vector for Cross-site-scripting (XSS) attacks. For example, the following code shows how eval() might execute untrustedCode provided by a user: js const untrustedCode = \"alert('Potentially evil code!');\"; const adder = eval(untrustedCode); Websites with a Content Security Policy (CSP) that specifies script-src or default-src will prevent such code running by default. If you must allow the scripts to run via eval() , you can mitigate the risks by always assigning a TrustedScript instance instead of a string, and enforcing trusted types using the require-trusted-types-for CSP directive. This ensures that the input is passed through a transformation function. To allow eval() to run, you additionally need to specify the trusted-types-eval keyword in your CSP script-src directive. The unsafe-eval keyword also allows eval() , but is much less safe then trusted-types-eval because it would allow execution even on browsers that do not support trusted types. For example, the required CSP for your site might look like this: http Content-Security-Policy: require-trusted-types-for 'script'; script-src '<your_allowlist>' 'trusted-types-eval' The behavior of the transformation function implemented in your trusted types policy depends on the specific use case that requires a user provided script. If possible, you should lock the allowed scripts to exactly the code that you trust to run. If that is not possible, you might allow or block the use of certain functions within the provided input. Examples Note that the first example shows how to use the method with trusted types. The other examples omit this step for brevity. Using TrustedScript To mitigate the risk of XSS, we should always assign TrustedScript instances to the script parameter. We also need to do this if we're enforcing trusted types for other reasons and we want to allow some script sources that have been permitted (by CSP: script-src ). Trusted types are not yet supported on all browsers, so first we define the trusted types tinyfill . This acts as a transparent replacement for the Trusted Types JavaScript API: js if (typeof trustedTypes === \"undefined\") trustedTypes = { createPolicy: (n, rules) => rules }; Next we create a TrustedTypePolicy that defines a createScript() method for transforming input strings into TrustedScript instances. For the purpose of this example, we'll assume that we have a function transformedScript() that defines our transformation/filtering logic. js const policy = trustedTypes.createPolicy(\"script-policy\", { createScript(input) { const transformed = transformedScript(input); // Our filter method return transformed; }, }); Then we use the policy object to create a TrustedScript object from a potentially unsafe input string: js // The potentially malicious string const untrustedScript = \"alert('Potentially evil code!');\"; // Create a TrustedScriptURL instance using the policy const trustedScript = policy.createScript(untrustedScript); The TrustedScript object can now be passed to eval() : js eval(trustedScript); Using eval() In the following code, both of the statements containing eval() return 42. The first evaluates the string \"x + y + 1\" ; the second evaluates the string \"42\" . js const x = 2; const y = 39; const z = \"42\"; eval(\"x + y + 1\"); // 42 eval(z); // 42 eval() returns the completion value of statements eval() returns the completion value of statements. For if , it would be the last expression or statement evaluated. js const str = \"if (a) { 1 + 1 } else { 1 + 2 }\"; let a = true; let b = eval(str); console.log(`b is: ${b}`); // b is: 2 a = false; b = eval(str); console.log(`b is: ${b}`); // b is: 3 The following example uses eval() to evaluate the string str . This string consists of JavaScript statements that assign z a value of 42 if x is five, and assign 0 to z otherwise. When the second statement is executed, eval() will cause these statements to be performed, and it will also evaluate the set of statements and return the value that is assigned to z , because the completion value of an assignment is the assigned value. js const x = 5; const str = `if (x === 5) { console.log(\"z is 42\"); z = 42; } else { z = 0; }`; console.log(\"z is \", eval(str)); // z is 42 z is 42 If you assign multiple values then the last value is returned. js let x = 5; const str = `if (x === 5) { console.log(\"z is 42\"); z = 42; x = 420; } else { z = 0; }`; console.log(\"x is\", eval(str)); // z is 42 x is 420 eval() as a string defining function requires \"(\" and \")\" as prefix and suffix js // This is a function declaration const fctStr1 = \"function a() {}\"; // This is a function expression const fctStr2 = \"(function b() {})\"; const fct1 = eval(fctStr1); // return undefined, but `a` is available as a global function now const fct2 = eval(fctStr2); // return the function `b` Specifications Specification ECMAScriptÂ® 2026 LanguageÂ Specification # sec-eval-x Browser compatibility See also Property accessors WebExtensions: Using eval in content scripts Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on Jan 21, 2026 by MDN contributors .

Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The for...in statement iterates over all enumerable string properties of an object (ignoring properties keyed by symbols ), including inherited enumerable properties. Try it const object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }; for (const property in object) { console.log(`${property}: ${object[property]}`); } // Expected output: // \"a: 1\" // \"b: 2\" // \"c: 3\" Syntax js for (variable in object) statement Parameters variable Receives a string property name on each iteration. May be either a declaration with const , let , or var , or an assignment target (e.g., a previously declared variable, an object property, or a destructuring pattern ). Variables declared with var are not local to the loop, i.e., they are in the same scope the for...in loop is in. object Object whose non-symbol enumerable properties are iterated over. statement A statement to be executed on every iteration. May reference variable . You can use a block statement to execute multiple statements. Description The loop will iterate over all enumerable properties of the object itself and those the object inherits from its prototype chain (properties of nearer prototypes take precedence over those of prototypes further away from the object in its prototype chain). Like other looping statements, you can use control flow statements inside statement : break stops statement execution and goes to the first statement after the loop. continue stops statement execution and goes to the next iteration of the loop. A for...in loop only iterates over enumerable, non-symbol properties. Objects created from builtâin constructors like Array and Object have inherited nonâenumerable properties from Array.prototype and Object.prototype , such as Array 's indexOf() method or Object 's toString() method, which will not be visited in the for...in loop. The traversal order, as of modern ECMAScript specification, is well-defined and consistent across implementations. Within each component of the prototype chain, all non-negative integer keys (those that can be array indices) will be traversed first in ascending order by value, then other string keys in ascending chronological order of property creation. The variable part of for...in accepts anything that can come before the = operator. You can use const to declare the variable as long as it's not reassigned within the loop body (it can change between iterations, because those are two separate variables). Otherwise, you can use let . You can use destructuring to assign multiple local variables, or use a property accessor like for (x.y in iterable) to assign the value to an object property. However, using and await using are not allowed, because the variable is always a string or symbol while these declarations require a disposable object. A legacy syntax allows var declarations of the loop variable to have an initializer. This throws a syntax error in strict mode and is ignored in nonâstrict mode. Deleted, added, or modified properties for...in visits property keys in the following fashion: It first gets all own string keys of the current object, in a fashion very similar to Object.getOwnPropertyNames() . For each key, if no string with the same value has ever been visited, the property descriptor is retrieved and the property is only visited if it is enumerable. However, this property string will be marked as visited even if it's not enumerable. Then, the current object is replaced with its prototype, and the process is repeated. This means: Any property added to the currently visited object during iteration will not be visited, because all own properties of the current object have already been saved beforehand. If multiple objects in the prototype chain have a property with the same name, only the first one will be considered, and it is only visited if it's enumerable. If it is non-enumerable, no other properties with the same name further up the prototype chain will be visited, even if they are enumerable. In general, it is best not to add, modify, or remove properties from the object during iteration, other than the property currently being visited. The spec explicitly allows the implementation to not follow the algorithm above in one of the following cases: The object's prototype chain is modified during iteration. A property is deleted from the object or its prototype chain during iteration. A property is added to the object's prototype chain during iteration. A property's enumerability is changed during iteration. In these cases, implementations may behave differently from what you may expect, or even from each other. Array iteration and for...in Array indexes are just enumerable properties with integer names and are otherwise identical to general object properties. The for...in loop will traverse all integer keys before traversing other keys, and in strictly increasing order, making the behavior of for...in close to normal array iteration. However, the for...in loop will return all enumerable properties, including those with nonâinteger names and those that are inherited. Unlike for...of , for...in uses property enumeration instead of the array's iterator. In sparse arrays , for...of will visit the empty slots, but for...in will not. It is better to use a for loop with a numeric index, Array.prototype.forEach() , or the for...of loop, because they will return the index as a number instead of a string, and also avoid non-index properties. Iterating over own properties only If you only want to consider properties attached to the object itself, and not its prototypes, you can use one of the following techniques: Object.keys() Object.getOwnPropertyNames() Object.keys will return a list of enumerable own string properties, while Object.getOwnPropertyNames will also contain non-enumerable ones. Many JavaScript style guides and linters recommend against the use of for...in , because it iterates over the entire prototype chain which is rarely what one wants, and may be a confusion with the more widely-used for...of loop. for...in is most practically used for debugging purposes, being an easy way to check the properties of an object (by outputting to the console or otherwise). In situations where objects are used as ad hoc key-value pairs, for...in allows you check if any of those keys hold a particular value. Examples Using for...in The for...in loop below iterates over all of the object's enumerable, non-symbol properties and logs a string of the property names and their values. js const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }; for (const prop in obj) { console.log(`obj.${prop} = ${obj[prop]}`); } // Logs: // \"obj.a = 1\" // \"obj.b = 2\" // \"obj.c = 3\" Iterating own properties The following function illustrates the use of Object.hasOwn() : the inherited properties are not displayed. js const triangle = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }; function ColoredTriangle() { this.color = \"red\"; } ColoredTriangle.prototype = triangle; const obj = new ColoredTriangle(); for (const prop in obj) { if (Object.hasOwn(obj, prop)) { console.log(`obj.${prop} = ${obj[prop]}`); } } // Logs: // \"obj.color = red\" Concurrent modification Warning: You should not write code like this yourself. It is only included here to illustrate the behavior of for...in in some corner cases. Properties added to the current object during iteration are never visited: js const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 }; for (const prop in obj) { console.log(`obj.${prop} = ${obj[prop]}`); obj.c = 3; } // Logs: // obj.a = 1 // obj.b = 2 Shadowed properties are only visited once: js const proto = { a: 1 }; const obj = { __proto__: proto, a: 2 }; for (const prop in obj) { console.log(`obj.${prop} = ${obj[prop]}`); } // Logs: // obj.a = 2 Object.defineProperty(obj, \"a\", { enumerable: false }); for (const prop in obj) { console.log(`obj.${prop} = ${obj[prop]}`); } // Logs nothing, because the first \"a\" property visited is non-enumerable. In addition, consider the following cases, where the behavior is unspecified, and implementations tend to diverge from the specified algorithm: Changing the prototype during iteration: js const obj = { a: 1, b: 2 }; for (const prop in obj) { console.log(`obj.${prop} = ${obj[prop]}`); Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, { c: 3 }); } Deleting a property during iteration: js const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }; // Deleting a property before it is visited for (const prop in obj) { console.log(`obj.${prop} = ${obj[prop]}`); delete obj.c; } const obj2 = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }; // Deleting a property after it is visited for (const prop in obj2) { console.log(`obj2.${prop} = ${obj2[prop]}`); delete obj2.a; } Enumerable properties added to the prototype during iteration: js const proto = {}; const obj = { __proto__: proto, a: 1, b: 2 }; for (const prop in obj) { console.log(`obj.${prop} = ${obj[prop]}`); proto.c = 3; } Changing the enumerability of a property during iteration: js const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }; for (const prop in obj) { console.log(`obj.${prop} = ${obj[prop]}`); Object.defineProperty(obj, \"c\", { enumerable: false }); } Specifications Specification ECMAScriptÂ® 2026 LanguageÂ Specification # sec-for-in-and-for-of-statements Browser compatibility See also for...of for Enumerability and ownership of properties Object.getOwnPropertyNames() Object.hasOwn() Array.prototype.forEach() Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on Jul 29, 2025 by MDN contributors .

Itâs been available across browsers since July 2015. * Some parts of this feature may have varying levels of support. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The Object type represents one of JavaScript's data types . It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor or the object initializer / literal syntax . Description Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of Object ; a typical object inherits properties (including methods) from Object.prototype , although these properties may be shadowed (a.k.a. overridden). The only objects that don't inherit from Object.prototype are those with null prototype , or descended from other null prototype objects. Changes to the Object.prototype object are seen by all objects through prototype chaining, unless the properties and methods subject to those changes are overridden further along the prototype chain. This provides a very powerful although potentially dangerous mechanism to override or extend object behavior. To make it more secure, Object.prototype is the only object in the core JavaScript language that has immutable prototype â the prototype of Object.prototype is always null and not changeable. Object prototype properties You should avoid calling any of the Object.prototype methods directly from the instance, especially those that are not intended to be polymorphic (i.e., only its initial behavior makes sense and no descending object could override it in a meaningful way). All objects descending from Object.prototype may define a custom own property that has the same name, but with entirely different semantics from what you expect. Furthermore, these properties are not inherited by null -prototype objects . All modern JavaScript utilities for working with objects are static . More specifically: valueOf() , toString() , and toLocaleString() exist to be polymorphic and you should expect the object to define its own implementation with sensible behaviors, so you can call them as instance methods. However, valueOf() and toString() are usually implicitly called through type conversion and you don't need to call them yourself in your code. __defineGetter__() , __defineSetter__() , __lookupGetter__() , and __lookupSetter__() are deprecated and should not be used. Use the static alternatives Object.defineProperty() and Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() instead. The __proto__ property is deprecated and should not be used. The Object.getPrototypeOf() and Object.setPrototypeOf() alternatives are static methods. The propertyIsEnumerable() and hasOwnProperty() methods can be replaced with the Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() and Object.hasOwn() static methods, respectively. The isPrototypeOf() method can usually be replaced with instanceof , if you are checking the prototype property of a constructor. In case where a semantically equivalent static method doesn't exist, or if you really want to use the Object.prototype method, you should directly call() the Object.prototype method on your target object instead, to prevent the object from having an overriding property that produces unexpected results. js const obj = { foo: 1, // You should not define such a method on your own object, // but you may not be able to prevent it from happening if // you are receiving the object from external input propertyIsEnumerable() { return false; }, }; obj.propertyIsEnumerable(\"foo\"); // false; unexpected result Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(obj, \"foo\"); // true; expected result Deleting a property from an object There isn't any method in an Object itself to delete its own properties (such as Map.prototype.delete() ). To do so, one must use the delete operator. null-prototype objects Almost all objects in JavaScript ultimately inherit from Object.prototype (see inheritance and the prototype chain ). However, you may create null -prototype objects using Object.create(null) or the object initializer syntax with __proto__: null (note: the __proto__ key in object literals is different from the deprecated Object.prototype.__proto__ property). You can also change the prototype of an existing object to null by calling Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, null) . js const obj = Object.create(null); const obj2 = { __proto__: null }; An object with a null prototype can behave in unexpected ways, because it doesn't inherit any object methods from Object.prototype . This is especially true when debugging, since common object-property converting/detecting utility functions may generate errors, or lose information (especially if using silent error-traps that ignore errors). For example, the lack of Object.prototype.toString() often makes debugging intractable: js const normalObj = {}; // create a normal object const nullProtoObj = Object.create(null); // create an object with \"null\" prototype console.log(`normalObj is: ${normalObj}`); // shows \"normalObj is: [object Object]\" console.log(`nullProtoObj is: ${nullProtoObj}`); // throws error: Cannot convert object to primitive value alert(normalObj); // shows [object Object] alert(nullProtoObj); // throws error: Cannot convert object to primitive value Other methods will fail as well. js normalObj.valueOf(); // shows {} nullProtoObj.valueOf(); // throws error: nullProtoObj.valueOf is not a function normalObj.hasOwnProperty(\"p\"); // shows \"true\" nullProtoObj.hasOwnProperty(\"p\"); // throws error: nullProtoObj.hasOwnProperty is not a function normalObj.constructor; // shows \"Object() { [native code] }\" nullProtoObj.constructor; // shows \"undefined\" We can add the toString method back to the null-prototype object by assigning it one: js nullProtoObj.toString = Object.prototype.toString; // since new object lacks toString, add the original generic one back console.log(nullProtoObj.toString()); // shows \"[object Object]\" console.log(`nullProtoObj is: ${nullProtoObj}`); // shows \"nullProtoObj is: [object Object]\" Unlike normal objects, in which toString() is on the object's prototype, the toString() method here is an own property of nullProtoObj . This is because nullProtoObj has no ( null ) prototype. You can also revert a null-prototype object back to an ordinary object using Object.setPrototypeOf(nullProtoObj, Object.prototype) . In practice, objects with null prototype are usually used as a cheap substitute for maps . The presence of Object.prototype properties will cause some bugs: js const ages = { alice: 18, bob: 27 }; function hasPerson(name) { return name in ages; } function getAge(name) { return ages[name]; } hasPerson(\"hasOwnProperty\"); // true getAge(\"toString\"); // [Function: toString] Using a null-prototype object removes this hazard without introducing too much complexity to the hasPerson and getAge functions: js const ages = Object.create(null, { alice: { value: 18, enumerable: true }, bob: { value: 27, enumerable: true }, }); hasPerson(\"hasOwnProperty\"); // false getAge(\"toString\"); // undefined In such case, the addition of any method should be done cautiously, as they can be confused with the other key-value pairs stored as data. Making your object not inherit from Object.prototype also prevents prototype pollution attacks . If a malicious script adds a property to Object.prototype , it will be accessible on every object in your program, except objects that have null prototype. js const user = {}; // A malicious script: Object.prototype.authenticated = true; // Unexpectedly allowing unauthenticated user to pass through if (user.authenticated) { // access confidential data } JavaScript also has built-in APIs that produce null -prototype objects, especially those that use objects as ad hoc key-value collections. For example: The return value of Object.groupBy() The groups and indices.groups properties of the result of RegExp.prototype.exec() Array.prototype[Symbol.unscopables] (all [Symbol.unscopables] objects should have null -prototype) import.meta Module namespace objects, obtained through import * as ns from \"module\"; or import() The term \" null -prototype object\" often also includes any object without Object.prototype in its prototype chain. Such objects can be created with extends null when using classes. Object coercion Many built-in operations that expect objects first coerce their arguments to objects. The operation can be summarized as follows: Objects are returned as-is. undefined and null throw a TypeError . Number , String , Boolean , Symbol , BigInt primitives are wrapped into their corresponding object wrappers. There are two ways to achieve nearly the same effect in JavaScript. Object.prototype.valueOf() : Object.prototype.valueOf.call(x) does exactly the object coercion steps explained above to convert x . The Object() function: Object(x) uses the same algorithm to convert x , except that undefined and null don't throw a TypeError , but return a plain object. Places that use object coercion include: The object parameter of for...in loops. The this value of Array methods. Parameters of Object methods such as Object.keys() . Auto-boxing when a property is accessed on a primitive value, since primitives do not have properties. The this value when calling a non-strict function. Primitives are boxed while null and undefined are replaced with the global object . Unlike conversion to primitives , the object coercion process itself is not observable in any way, since it doesn't invoke custom code like toString or valueOf methods. Constructor Object() Turns the input into an object. Static methods Object.assign() Copies the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. Object.create() Creates a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. Object.defineProperties() Adds the named properties described by the given descriptors to an object. Object.defineProperty() Adds the named property described by a given descriptor to an object. Object.entries() Returns an array containing all of the [key, value] pairs of a given object's own enumerable string properties. Object.freeze() Freezes an object. Other code cannot delete or change its properties. Object.fromEntries() Returns a new object from an iterable of [key, value] pairs. (This is the reverse of Object.entries ). Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() Returns a property descriptor for a named property on an object. Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors() Returns an object containing all own property descriptors for an object. Object.getOwnPropertyNames() Returns an array containing the names of all of the given object's own enumerable and non-enumerable properties. Object.getOwnPropertySymbols() Returns an array of all symbol properties found directly upon a given object. Object.getPrototypeOf() Returns the prototype (internal [[Prototype]] property) of the specified object. Object.groupBy() Groups the elements of a given iterable according to the string values returned by a provided callback function. The returned object has separate properties for each group, containing arrays with the elements in the group. Object.hasOwn() Returns true if the specified object has the indicated property as its own property, or false if the property is inherited or does not exist. Object.is() Compares if two values are the same value. Equates all NaN values (which differs from both IsLooselyEqual used by == and IsStrictlyEqual used by === ). Object.isExtensible() Determines if extending of an object is allowed. Object.isFrozen() Determines if an object was frozen. Object.isSealed() Determines if an object is sealed. Object.keys() Returns an array containing the names of all of the given object's own enumerable string properties. Object.preventExtensions() Prevents any extensions of an object. Object.seal() Prevents other code from deleting properties of an object. Object.setPrototypeOf() Sets the object's prototype (its internal [[Prototype]] property). Object.values() Returns an array containing the values that correspond to all of a given object's own enumerable string properties. Instance properties These properties are defined on Object.prototype and shared by all Object instances. Object.prototype.__proto__ Deprecated Points to the object which was used as prototype when the object was instantiated. Object.prototype.constructor The constructor function that created the instance object. For plain Object instances, the initial value is the Object constructor. Instances of other constructors each inherit the constructor property from their respective Constructor.prototype object. Instance methods Object.prototype.__defineGetter__() Deprecated Associates a function with a property that, when accessed, executes that function and returns its return value. Object.prototype.__defineSetter__() Deprecated Associates a function with a property that, when set, executes that function which modifies the property. Object.prototype.__lookupGetter__() Deprecated Returns the function bound as a getter to the specified property. Object.prototype.__lookupSetter__() Deprecated Returns the function bound as a setter to the specified property. Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty() Returns a boolean indicating whether an object contains the specified property as a direct property of that object and not inherited through the prototype chain. Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf() Returns a boolean indicating whether the object this method is called upon is in the prototype chain of the specified object. Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable() Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified property is the object's enumerable own property. Object.prototype.toLocaleString() Calls toString() . Object.prototype.toString() Returns a string representation of the object. Object.prototype.valueOf() Returns the primitive value of the specified object. Examples Constructing empty objects The following example creates empty objects using the new keyword with different arguments: js const o1 = new Object(); const o2 = new Object(undefined); const o3 = new Object(null); Using Object() constructor to turn primitives into an Object of their respective type You can use the Object() constructor to create an object wrapper of a primitive value. The following examples create variables o1 and o2 which are objects storing Boolean and BigInt values: js // Equivalent to const o1 = new Boolean(true) const o1 = new Object(true); // No equivalent because BigInt() can't be called as a constructor, // and calling it as a regular function won't create an object const o2 = new Object(1n); Object prototypes When altering the behavior of existing Object.prototype methods, consider injecting code by wrapping your extension before or after the existing logic. For example, this (untested) code will pre-conditionally execute custom logic before the built-in logic or someone else's extension is executed. When modifying prototypes with hooks, pass this and the arguments (the call state) to the current behavior by calling apply() on the function. This pattern can be used for any prototype, such as Node.prototype , Function.prototype , etc. js const current = Object.prototype.valueOf; // Since my property \"-prop-value\" is cross-cutting and isn't always // on the same prototype chain, I want to modify Object.prototype: Object.prototype.valueOf = function (...args) { if (Object.hasOwn(this, \"-prop-value\")) { return this[\"-prop-value\"]; } // It doesn't look like one of my objects, so let's fall back on // the default behavior by reproducing the current behavior as best we can. // The apply behaves like \"super\" in some other languages. // Even though valueOf() doesn't take arguments, some other hook may. return current.apply(this, args); }; Warning: Modifying the prototype property of any built-in constructor is considered a bad practice and risks forward compatibility.

Itâs been available across browsers since July 2015. * Some parts of this feature may have varying levels of support. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The toString() method of Function instances returns a string representing the source code of this function. Try it function sum(a, b) { return a + b; } console.log(sum.toString()); // Expected output: \"function sum(a, b) { // return a + b; // }\" console.log(Math.abs.toString()); // Expected output: \"function abs() { [native code] }\" Syntax js toString() Parameters None. Return value A string representing the source code of the function. Description The Function object overrides the toString() method inherited from Object ; it does not inherit Object.prototype.toString . For user-defined Function objects, the toString method returns a string containing the source text segment which was used to define the function. JavaScript calls the toString method automatically when a Function is to be represented as a text value, e.g., when a function is concatenated with a string. The toString() method will throw a TypeError exception (\"Function.prototype.toString called on incompatible object\"), if its this value object is not a Function object. js Function.prototype.toString.call(\"foo\"); // throws TypeError If the toString() method is called on built-in function objects, a function created by Function.prototype.bind() , or other non-JavaScript functions, then toString() returns a native function string which looks like function someName() { [native code] } For intrinsic object methods and functions, someName is the initial name of the function; otherwise its content may be implementation-defined, but will always be in property name syntax, like [1 + 1] , someName , or 1 . Note: This means using eval() on native function strings is a guaranteed syntax error. If the toString() method is called on a function created by the Function constructor, toString() returns the source code of a synthesized function declaration named \"anonymous\" using the provided parameters and function body. For example, Function(\"a\", \"b\", \"return a + b\").toString() will return: function anonymous(a,b ) { return a + b } Since ES2018, the spec requires the return value of toString() to be the exact same source code as it was declared, including any whitespace and/or comments â or, if the host doesn't have the source code available for some reason, requires returning a native function string. Support for this revised behavior can be found in the compatibility table . Examples Comparing actual source code and toString results js function test(fn) { console.log(fn.toString()); } function f() {} class A { a() {} } function* g() {} test(f); // \"function f() {}\" test(A); // \"class A { a() {} }\" test(g); // \"function* g() {}\" test((a) => a); // \"(a) => a\" test({ a() {} }.a); // \"a() {}\" test({ *a() {} }.a); // \"*a() {}\" test({ [0]() {} }[0]); // \"[0]() {}\" test(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor({ get a() {} }, \"a\").get); // \"get a() {}\" test(Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor({ set a(x) {} }, \"a\").set); // \"set a(x) {}\" test(Function.prototype.toString); // \"function toString() { [native code] }\" test(function f() {}.bind(0)); // \"function () { [native code] }\" test(Function(\"a\", \"b\")); // function anonymous(a\\n) {\\nb\\n} Note that after the Function.prototype.toString() revision, when toString() is called, implementations are never allowed to synthesize a function's source that is not a native function string. The method always returns the exact source code used to create the function â including the getter and setter examples above. The Function constructor itself has the capability of synthesizing the source code for the function (and is therefore a form of implicit eval() ). Getting source text of a function It is possible to get the source text of a function by coercing it to a string â for example, by wrapping it in a template literal: js function foo() { return \"bar\"; } console.log(`${foo}`); // function foo() { // return \"bar\"; // } This source text is exact , including any interspersed comments (which won't be stored by the engine's internal representation otherwise). js function foo /* a comment */() { return \"bar\"; } console.log(foo.toString()); // function foo /* a comment */() { // return \"bar\"; // } Specifications Specification ECMAScriptÂ® 2026 LanguageÂ Specification # sec-function.prototype.tostring Browser compatibility See also Object.prototype.toString() Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on Jul 10, 2025 by MDN contributors .

      "text_content": "JavaScript technologies overview Whereas HTML defines a webpage's structure and content and CSS sets the formatting and appearance, JavaScript adds interactivity to a webpage and creates rich web applications. However, the umbrella term \"JavaScript\" as understood in a web browser context contains several very different elements. One of them is the core language (ECMAScript), another is the collection of the Web APIs , including the DOM (Document Object Model). JavaScript, the core language (ECMAScript) The core language of JavaScript is standardized by the ECMA TC39 committee as a language named ECMAScript. \"ECMAScript\" is the term for the language standard, but \"ECMAScript\" and \"JavaScript\" can be used interchangeably. This core language is also used in non-browser environments, for example in Node.js . What falls under the ECMAScript scope? Among other things, ECMAScript defines: Language syntax (parsing rules, keywords, control flow, object literal initialization, ...) Error handling mechanisms ( throw , try...catch , ability to create user-defined Error types) Types (boolean, number, string, function, object, ...) A prototype-based inheritance mechanism Built-in objects and functions, including JSON , Math , Array methods, parseInt , decodeURI , etc. Strict mode A module system Basic memory model Standardization process ECMAScript editions are approved and published as a standard by the ECMA General Assembly on a yearly basis. All development is public on the Ecma TC39 GitHub organization , which hosts proposals, the official specification text, and meeting notes. Before the 6th edition of ECMAScript (known as ES6), specifications were published once every several years, and are commonly referred by their major version numbers â ES3, ES5, etc. After ES6, the specification is named by the publishing year â ES2017, ES2018, etc. ES6 is synonymous with ES2015. ESNext is a dynamic name that refers to whatever the next version is at the time of writing. ESNext features are more correctly called proposals, because, by definition, the specification has not been finalized yet. The current committee-approved snapshot of ECMA-262 is available in PDF and HTML format on Ecma International's ECMA-262 language specification page . ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 are continuously maintained and kept up to date by the specification editors; the TC39 website hosts the latest, up-to-date ECMA-262 and ECMA-402 versions. New language features, including introduction of new syntaxes and APIs and revision of existing behaviors, are discussed in the form of proposals. Each proposal goes through a 4-stage process , and is typically implemented by JavaScript engines at stage 3 or stage 4 and thus available for public consumption. See Wikipedia ECMAScript entry for more information on ECMAScript history. Internationalization API The ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification is an addition to the ECMAScript Language Specification, also standardized by Ecma TC39. The internationalization API provides collation (string comparison), number formatting, and date-and-time formatting for JavaScript applications, letting the applications choose the language and tailor the functionality to their needs. The initial standard was approved in December 2012; the status of implementations in browsers is tracked in the documentation of the Intl object. The Internationalization specification is nowadays also ratified on a yearly basis and browsers constantly improve their implementation. Related resources There are a variety of ways you can participate in or just track current work on the ECMAScript Language Specification and the ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification and related resources: ECMAScript Language Specification repo ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification repo ECMAScript proposals repo ECMAScript conformance test suite repo TC39 meeting notes ECMAScript spec discussion; current mailing list ECMAScript spec discussion; historical mailing-list archives (until March 2021) DOM APIs WebIDL The WebIDL specification provides the glue between the DOM technologies and ECMAScript. The Core of the DOM The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform, language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and XML documents. Objects in the DOM tree may be addressed and manipulated by using methods on the objects. Nowadays, the DOM core spec is maintained by WHATWG (superseding the W3C version). It defines language-agnostic interfaces that abstract HTML and XML documents as objects, and also defines mechanisms to manipulate this abstraction. This includes: Node , Element , DocumentFragment , Document , DOMImplementation , Event , EventTarget , and more. From the ECMAScript point of view, objects defined in the DOM specification are called \"host objects\". HTML DOM HTML , the Web's markup language, is specified in terms of the DOM. Layered above the abstract concepts defined in DOM Core, HTML also defines the meaning of elements. The HTML DOM includes such things as the className property on HTML elements, or APIs such as Document.body . The HTML specification also defines restrictions on documents; for example, it requires all children of a <ul> element, which represents an unordered list, to be <li> elements, as those represent list items. In general, it also forbids using elements and attributes that aren't defined in a standard. Looking for the Document object, Window object, and the other DOM elements? Read the DOM documentation . Other notable APIs The setTimeout() and setInterval() functions were first specified on the Window interface in HTML Standard. XMLHttpRequest makes it possible to send asynchronous HTTP requests. The Fetch API provides a more ergonomic abstraction for network requests. The CSS Object Model abstract CSS rules as objects. WebWorkers allows parallel computation. WebSockets allows low-level bidirectional communication. Canvas 2D Context is a drawing API for <canvas> . The WebAssembly interface provides utilities for communication between JavaScript code and WebAssembly modules. Non-browser environments (like Node.js) often do not have DOM APIs â because they don't interact with a document â but they still usually implement many web APIs, such as fetch() and setTimeout() . JavaScript implementations JavaScript engines used in current web browsers include: Mozilla's SpiderMonkey , used in Firefox, Servo, and Flow. Other non-browser usage includes MongoDB, CouchDB, and more. This was the first ever JavaScript engine, created by Brendan Eich at Netscape. Google's V8 , used in Chrome and Chromium-based browsers such as Opera, Edge, and Brave. Other non-browser usage includes Node.js , Deno , Electron , and more. Apple's JavaScriptCore (also known as SquirrelFish/Nitro), used in Safari and other WebKit-based browsers. Other non-browser usage includes Bun . LibJS , used in Ladybird . Some JavaScript engines used in earlier browsers include: Carakan , used in Opera before it became a Chromium-based browser. Microsoft's Chakra , used in Internet Explorer (although the language it implements is formally called \"JScript\" to avoid trademark issues). Earlier versions of Edge used another JavaScript engine, confusingly also called Chakra , before it became a Chromium-based browser. Some JavaScript engines specifically tailored for non-browser purposes include: Engine262 , written in JavaScript and intended essentially as a reference implementation of the language. Meta's Hermes , optimized for React Native . Mozilla's Rhino , written in Java. Oracle's GraalJS , written in Java and built on top of GraalVM. Moddable XS , intended for IoT/embedded systems. QuickJS , intended to be small and lightweight. JavaScript engines expose a public API which application developers can use to integrate JavaScript into their software. By far, the most common host environment for JavaScript is web browsers. Web browsers typically use the public API to create host objects responsible for reflecting the DOM into JavaScript. Another common application for JavaScript is as a (Web) server-side scripting language. A JavaScript web server exposes host objects representing a HTTP request and response objects, which can then be manipulated by a JavaScript program to dynamically generate web pages. Node.js is a popular example of this. Shells A JavaScript shell allows you to quickly test snippets of JavaScript code without having to reload a web page. They are extremely useful for developing and debugging code. Standalone JavaScript shells The following JavaScript shells are stand-alone environments, like Perl or Python. Node.js - Node.js is a platform for easily building fast, scalable network applications. ShellJS - Portable Unix shell commands for Node.js. Browser-based JavaScript shells The following JavaScript shells run code through the browser's JavaScript engine. Firefox has a built-in JavaScript console , which support multi-line editing. Babel REPL - A browser-based REPL for experimenting with future JavaScript. TypeScript playground â A browser-based playground for experimenting both new JavaScript features (via the tsc compiler) and TypeScript syntax.

Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages â many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes and classes. It also supports functional programming since functions are first-class objects that can be easily created via expressions and passed around like any other object. This page serves as a quick overview of various JavaScript language features, written for readers with background in other languages, such as C or Java. Data types Let's start off by looking at the building blocks of any language: the types. JavaScript programs manipulate values, and those values all belong to a type. JavaScript offers seven primitive types : Number : used for all number values (integer and floating point) except for very big integers. BigInt : used for arbitrarily large integers. String : used to store text. Boolean : true and false â usually used for conditional logic. Symbol : used for creating unique identifiers that won't collide. Undefined : indicating that a variable has not been assigned a value. Null : indicating a deliberate non-value. Everything else is known as an Object . Common object types include: Function Array Map RegExp Error Functions aren't special data structures in JavaScript â they are just a special type of object that can be called. Numbers JavaScript has two built-in numeric types: Number and BigInt. The Number type is an IEEE 754 64-bit double-precision floating point value , which means integers can be safely represented between -(2 53 â 1) and 2 53 â 1 without loss of precision, and floating point numbers can be stored all the way up to 1.79 Ã 10 308 . Within numbers, JavaScript does not distinguish between floating point numbers and integers. js console.log(3 / 2); // 1.5, not 1 So an apparent integer is in fact implicitly a float . Because of IEEE 754 encoding, sometimes floating point arithmetic can be imprecise. js console.log(0.1 + 0.2); // 0.30000000000000004 For operations that expect integers, such as bitwise operations, the number will be converted to a 32-bit integer. Number literals can also have prefixes to indicate the base (binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal), or an exponent suffix. js console.log(0b111110111); // 503 console.log(0o767); // 503 console.log(0x1f7); // 503 console.log(5.03e2); // 503 The BigInt type is an arbitrary length integer. Its behavior is similar to C's integer types (e.g., division truncates to zero), except it can grow indefinitely. BigInts are specified with a number literal and an n suffix. js console.log(-3n / 2n); // -1n The standard arithmetic operators are supported, including addition, subtraction, remainder arithmetic, etc. BigInts and numbers cannot be mixed in arithmetic operations. The Math object provides standard mathematical functions and constants. js Math.sin(3.5); const circumference = 2 * Math.PI * r; There are three ways to convert a string to a number: parseInt() , which parses the string for an integer. parseFloat() , which parses the string for a floating-point number. The Number() function, which parses a string as if it's a number literal and supports many different number representations. You can also use the unary plus + as a shorthand for Number() . Number values also include NaN (short for \"Not a Number\") and Infinity . Many \"invalid math\" operations will return NaN â for example, if attempting to parse a non-numeric string, or using Math.log() on a negative value. Division by zero produces Infinity (positive or negative). NaN is contagious: if you provide it as an operand to any mathematical operation, the result will also be NaN . NaN is the only value in JavaScript that's not equal to itself (per IEEE 754 specification). Strings Strings in JavaScript are sequences of Unicode characters. This should be welcome news to anyone who has had to deal with internationalization. More accurately, they are UTF-16 encoded . js console.log(\"Hello, world\"); console.log(\"ä½ å¥½ï¼ä¸çï¼\"); // Nearly all Unicode characters can be written literally in string literals Strings can be written with either single or double quotes â JavaScript does not have the distinction between characters and strings. If you want to represent a single character, you just use a string consisting of that single character. js console.log(\"Hello\"[1] === \"e\"); // true To find the length of a string (in code units ), access its length property. Strings have utility methods to manipulate the string and access information about the string. Because all primitives are immutable by design, these methods return new strings. The + operator is overloaded for strings: when one of the operands is a string, it performs string concatenation instead of number addition. A special template literal syntax allows you to write strings with embedded expressions more succinctly. Unlike Python's f-strings or C#'s interpolated strings, template literals use backticks (not single or double quotes). js const age = 25; console.log(\"I am \" + age + \" years old.\"); // String concatenation console.log(`I am ${age} years old.`); // Template literal Other types JavaScript distinguishes between null , which indicates a deliberate non-value (and is only accessible through the null keyword), and undefined , which indicates absence of value. There are many ways to obtain undefined : A return statement with no value ( return; ) implicitly returns undefined . Accessing a nonexistent object property ( obj.iDontExist ) returns undefined . A variable declaration without initialization ( let x; ) will implicitly initialize the variable to undefined . JavaScript has a Boolean type, with possible values true and false â both of which are keywords. Any value can be converted to a boolean according to the following rules: false , 0 , empty strings ( \"\" ), NaN , null , and undefined all become false . All other values become true . You can perform this conversion explicitly using the Boolean() function: js Boolean(\"\"); // false Boolean(234); // true However, this is rarely necessary, as JavaScript will silently perform this conversion when it expects a boolean, such as in an if statement (see Control structures ). For this reason, we sometimes speak of \" truthy \" and \" falsy \", meaning values that become true and false , respectively, when used in boolean contexts. Boolean operations such as && (logical and ), || (logical or ), and ! (logical not ) are supported; see Operators . The Symbol type is often used to create unique identifiers. Every symbol created with the Symbol() function is guaranteed to be unique. In addition, there are registered symbols, which are shared constants, and well-known symbols, which are utilized by the language as \"protocols\" for certain operations. You can read more about them in the symbol reference . Variables Variables in JavaScript are declared using one of three keywords: let , const , or var . let allows you to declare block-level variables. The declared variable is available from the block it is enclosed in. js let a; let name = \"Simon\"; // myLetVariable is *not* visible out here for (let myLetVariable = 0; myLetVariable < 5; myLetVariable++) { // myLetVariable is only visible in here } // myLetVariable is *not* visible out here const allows you to declare variables whose values are never intended to change. The variable is available from the block it is declared in. js const Pi = 3.14; // Declare variable Pi console.log(Pi); // 3.14 A variable declared with const cannot be reassigned. js const Pi = 3.14; Pi = 1; // will throw an error because you cannot change a constant variable. const declarations only prevent reassignments â they don't prevent mutations of the variable's value, if it's an object. js const obj = {}; obj.a = 1; // no error console.log(obj); // { a: 1 } var declarations can have surprising behaviors (for example, they are not block-scoped), and they are discouraged in modern JavaScript code. If you declare a variable without assigning any value to it, its value is undefined . You can't declare a const variable without an initializer, because you can't change it later anyway. let and const declared variables still occupy the entire scope they are defined in, and are in a region known as the temporal dead zone before the actual line of declaration. This has some interesting interactions with variable shadowing, which don't occur in other languages. js function foo(x, condition) { if (condition) { console.log(x); const x = 2; console.log(x); } } foo(1, true); In most other languages, this would log \"1\" and \"2\", because before the const x = 2 line, x should still refer to the parameter x in the upper scope. In JavaScript, because each declaration occupies the entire scope, this would throw an error on the first console.log : \"Cannot access 'x' before initialization\". For more information, see the reference page of let . JavaScript is dynamically typed . Types (as described in the previous section ) are only associated with values, but not with variables. For let -declared variables, you can always change its type through reassignment. js let a = 1; a = \"foo\"; Operators JavaScript's numeric operators include + , - , * , / , % (remainder), and ** (exponentiation). Values are assigned using = . Each binary operator also has a compound assignment counterpart such as += and -= , which extend out to x = x operator y . js x += 5; x = x + 5; You can use ++ and -- to increment and decrement respectively. These can be used as a prefix or postfix operators. The + operator also does string concatenation: js \"hello\" + \" world\"; // \"hello world\" If you add a string to a number (or other value) everything is converted into a string first. This might trip you up: js \"3\" + 4 + 5; // \"345\" 3 + 4 + \"5\"; // \"75\" Adding an empty string to something is a useful way of converting it to a string itself. Comparisons in JavaScript can be made using < , > , <= and >= , which work for both strings and numbers. For equality, the double-equals operator performs type coercion if you give it different types, with sometimes interesting results. On the other hand, the triple-equals operator does not attempt type coercion, and is usually preferred. js 123 == \"123\"; // true 1 == true; // true 123 === \"123\"; // false 1 === true; // false The double-equals and triple-equals also have their inequality counterparts: != and !== . JavaScript also has bitwise operators and logical operators . Notably, logical operators don't work with boolean values only â they work by the \"truthiness\" of the value. js const a = 0 && \"Hello\"; // 0 because 0 is \"falsy\" const b = \"Hello\" || \"world\"; // \"Hello\" because both \"Hello\" and \"world\" are \"truthy\" The && and || operators use short-circuit logic, which means whether they will execute their second operand is dependent on the first. This is useful for checking for null objects before accessing their attributes: js const name = o && o.getName(); Or for caching values (when falsy values are invalid): js const name = cachedName || (cachedName = getName()); For a comprehensive list of operators, see the guide page or reference section . You may be especially interested in the operator precedence . Grammar JavaScript grammar is very similar to the C family. There are a few points worth mentioning: Identifiers can have Unicode characters, but they cannot be one of the reserved words . Comments are commonly // or /* */ , while many other scripting languages like Perl, Python, and Bash use # . Semicolons are optional in JavaScript â the language automatically inserts them when needed. However, there are certain caveats to watch out for, since unlike Python, semicolons are still part of the syntax. For an in-depth look at the JavaScript grammar, see the reference page for lexical grammar . Control structures JavaScript has a similar set of control structures to other languages in the C family. Conditional statements are supported by if and else ; you can chain them together: js let name = \"kittens\"; if (name === \"puppies\") { name += \" woof\"; } else if (name === \"kittens\") { name += \" meow\"; } else { name += \"!\"; } name === \"kittens meow\"; JavaScript doesn't have elif , and else if is really just an else branch comprised of a single if statement. JavaScript has while loops and do...while loops. The first is good for basic looping; the second is for loops where you wish to ensure that the body of the loop is executed at least once: js while (true) { // an infinite loop! } let input; do { input = get_input(); } while (inputIsNotValid(input)); JavaScript's for loop is the same as that in C and Java: it lets you provide the control information for your loop on a single line. js for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { // Will execute 5 times } JavaScript also contains two other prominent for loops: for...of , which iterates over iterables , most notably arrays, and for...in , which visits all enumerable properties of an object. js for (const value of array) { // do something with value } for (const property in object) { // do something with object property } The switch statement can be used for multiple branches based on equality checking. js switch (action) { case \"draw\": drawIt(); break; case \"eat\": eatIt(); break; default: doNothing(); } Similar to C, case clauses are conceptually the same as labels , so if you don't add a break statement, execution will \"fall through\" to the next level. However, they are not actually jump tables â any expression can be part of the case clause, not just string or number literals, and they would be evaluated one-by-one until one equals the value being matched. Comparison takes place between the two using the === operator. Unlike some languages like Rust, control-flow structures are statements in JavaScript, meaning you can't assign them to a variable, like const a = if (x) { 1 } else { 2 } . JavaScript errors are handled using the try...catch statement. js try { buildMySite(\"./website\"); } catch (e) { console.error(\"Building site failed:\", e); } Errors can be thrown using the throw statement. Many built-in operations may throw as well. js function buildMySite(siteDirectory) { if (!pathExists(siteDirectory)) { throw new Error(\"Site directory does not exist\"); } } In general, you can't tell the type of the error you just caught, because anything can be thrown from a throw statement. However, you can usually assume it's an Error instance, as is the example above. There are some subclasses of Error built-in, like TypeError and RangeError , that you can use to provide extra semantics about the error. There's no conditional catch in JavaScript â if you only want to handle one type of error, you need to catch everything, identify the type of error using instanceof , and then rethrow the other cases. js try { buildMySite(\"./website\"); } catch (e) { if (e instanceof RangeError) { console.error(\"Seems like a parameter is out of range:\", e); console.log(\"Retrying...\"); buildMySite(\"./website\"); } else { // Don't know how to handle other error types; throw them so // something else up in the call stack may catch and handle it throw e; } } If an error is uncaught by any try...catch in the call stack, the program will exit. For a comprehensive list of control flow statements, see the reference section . Objects JavaScript objects can be thought of as collections of key-value pairs. As such, they are similar to: Dictionaries in Python. Hashes in Perl and Ruby. Hash tables in C and C++. HashMaps in Java. Associative arrays in PHP. JavaScript objects are hashes. Unlike objects in statically typed languages, objects in JavaScript do not have fixed shapes â properties can be added, deleted, re-ordered, mutated, or dynamically queried at any time. Object keys are always strings or symbols â even array indices, which are canonically integers, are actually strings under the hood. Objects are usually created using the literal syntax: js const obj = { name: \"Carrot\", for: \"Max\", details: { color: \"orange\", size: 12, }, }; Object properties can be accessed using dot ( . ) or square brackets ( [] ). When using the dot notation, the key must be a valid identifier . Square brackets, on the other hand, allow indexing the object with a dynamic key value. js // Dot notation obj.name = \"Simon\"; const name = obj.name; // Bracket notation obj[\"name\"] = \"Simon\"; const name = obj[\"name\"]; // Can use a variable to define a key const userName = prompt(\"what is your key?\"); obj[userName] = prompt(\"what is its value?\"); Property access can be chained together: js obj.details.color; // orange obj[\"details\"][\"size\"]; // 12 Objects are always references, so unless something is explicitly copying the object, mutations to an object would be visible to the outside. js const obj = {}; function doSomething(o) { o.x = 1; } doSomething(obj); console.log(obj.x); // 1 This also means two separately created objects will never be equal ( !== ), because they are different references. If you hold two references of the same object, mutating one would be observable through the other. js const me = {}; const stillMe = me; me.x = 1; console.log(stillMe.x); // 1 For more on objects and prototypes, see the Object reference page . For more information on the object initializer syntax, see its reference page . This page has omitted all details about object prototypes and inheritance because you can usually achieve inheritance with classes without touching the underlying mechanism (which you may have heard to be abstruse). To learn about them, see Inheritance and the prototype chain . Arrays Arrays in JavaScript are actually a special type of object. They work very much like regular objects (numerical properties can naturally be accessed only using [] syntax) but they have one magic property called length . This is always one more than the highest index in the array. Arrays are usually created with array literals: js const a = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"hen\"]; a.length; // 3 JavaScript arrays are still objects â you can assign any properties to them, including arbitrary number indices. The only \"magic\" is that length will be automatically updated when you set a particular index. js const a = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"hen\"]; a[100] = \"fox\"; console.log(a.length); // 101 console.log(a); // ['dog', 'cat', 'hen', empty Ã 97, 'fox'] The array we got above is called a sparse array because there are uninhabited slots in the middle, and will cause the engine to deoptimize it from an array to a hash table. Make sure your array is densely populated! Out-of-bounds indexing doesn't throw. If you query a non-existent array index, you'll get a value of undefined in return: js const a = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"hen\"]; console.log(typeof a[90]); // undefined Arrays can have any elements and can grow or shrink arbitrarily. js const arr = [1, \"foo\", true]; arr.push({}); // arr = [1, \"foo\", true, {}] Arrays can be iterated with the for loop, as you can in other C-like languages: js for (let i = 0; i < a.length; i++) { // Do something with a[i] } Or, since arrays are iterable, you can use the for...of loop, which is synonymous to C++/Java's for (int x : arr) syntax: js for (const currentValue of a) { // Do something with currentValue } Arrays come with a plethora of array methods . Many of them would iterate the array â for example, map() would apply a callback to every array element, and return a new array: js const babies = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"hen\"].map((name) => `baby ${name}`); // babies = ['baby dog', 'baby cat', 'baby hen'] Functions Along with objects, functions are the core component in understanding JavaScript. The most basic function declaration looks like this: js function add(x, y) { const total = x + y; return total; } A JavaScript function can take 0 or more parameters. The function body can contain as many statements as you like and can declare its own variables which are local to that function. The return statement can be used to return a value at any time, terminating the function. If no return statement is used (or an empty return with no value), JavaScript returns undefined . Functions can be called with more or fewer parameters than it specifies. If you call a function without passing the parameters it expects, they will be set to undefined . If you pass more parameters than it expects, the function will ignore the extra parameters. js add(); // NaN // Equivalent to add(undefined, undefined) add(2, 3, 4); // 5 // added the first two; 4 was ignored There are a number of other parameter syntaxes available. For example, the rest parameter syntax allows collecting all the extra parameters passed by the caller into an array, similar to Python's *args . (Since JS doesn't have named parameters on the language level, there's no **kwargs .) js function avg(...args) { let sum = 0; for (const item of args) { sum += item; } return sum / args.length; } avg(2, 3, 4, 5); // 3.5 In the above code, the variable args holds all the values that were passed into the function. The rest parameter will store all arguments after where it's declared, but not before. In other words, function avg(firstValue, ...args) will store the first value passed into the function in the firstValue variable and the remaining arguments in args . If a function accepts a list of arguments and you already hold them in an array, you can use the spread syntax in the function call to spread the array as a list of elements. For instance: avg(...numbers) . We mentioned that JavaScript doesn't have named parameters. It's possible, though, to implement them using object destructuring , which allows objects to be conveniently packed and unpacked. js // Note the { } braces: this is destructuring an object function area({ width, height }) { return width * height; } // The { } braces here create a new object console.log(area({ width: 2, height: 3 })); There's also the default parameter syntax, which allows omitted parameters (or those passed as undefined ) to have a default value. js function avg(firstValue, secondValue, thirdValue = 0) { return (firstValue + secondValue + thirdValue) / 3; } avg(1, 2); // 1, instead of NaN Anonymous functions JavaScript lets you create anonymous functions â that is, functions without names. In practice, anonymous functions are typically used as arguments to other functions, immediately assigned to a variable that can be used to invoke the function, or returned from another function. js // Note that there's no function name before the parentheses const avg = function (...args) { let sum = 0; for (const item of args) { sum += item; } return sum / args.length; }; That makes the anonymous function invocable by calling avg() with some arguments â that is, it's semantically equivalent to declaring the function using the function avg() {} declaration syntax. There's another way to define anonymous functions â using an arrow function expression . js // Note that there's no function name before the parentheses const avg = (...args) => { let sum = 0; for (const item of args) { sum += item; } return sum / args.length; }; // You can omit the `return` when simply returning an expression const sum = (a, b, c) => a + b + c; Arrow functions are not semantically equivalent to function expressions â for more information, see its reference page . There's another way that anonymous functions can be useful: it can be simultaneously declared and invoked in a single expression, called an Immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) : js (function () { // â¦ })(); For use-cases of IIFEs, you can read emulating private methods with closures . Recursive functions JavaScript allows you to call functions recursively. This is particularly useful for dealing with tree structures, such as those found in the browser DOM. js function countChars(elm) { if (elm.nodeType === 3) { // TEXT_NODE return elm.nodeValue.length; } let count = 0; for (let i = 0, child; (child = elm.childNodes[i]); i++) { count += countChars(child); } return count; } Function expressions can be named as well, which allows them to be recursive. js const charsInBody = (function counter(elm) { if (elm.nodeType === 3) { // TEXT_NODE return elm.nodeValue.length; } let count = 0; for (let i = 0, child; (child = elm.childNodes[i]); i++) { count += counter(child); } return count; })(document.body); The name provided to a function expression as above is only available to the function's own scope. This allows more optimizations to be done by the engine and results in more readable code. The name also shows up in the debugger and some stack traces, which can save you time when debugging. If you are used to functional programming, beware of the performance implications of recursion in JavaScript. Although the language specification specifies tail-call optimization , only JavaScriptCore (used by Safari) has implemented it, due to the difficulty of recovering stack traces and debuggability. For deep recursion, consider using iteration instead to avoid stack overflow. Functions are first-class objects JavaScript functions are first-class objects. This means that they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from other functions. In addition, JavaScript supports closures out-of-the-box without explicit capturing, allowing you to conveniently apply functional programming styles. js // Function returning function const add = (x) => (y) => x + y; // Function accepting function const babies = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"hen\"].map((name) => `baby ${name}`); Note that JavaScript functions are themselves objects â like everything else in JavaScript â and you can add or change properties on them just like we've seen earlier in the Objects section. Inner functions JavaScript function declarations are allowed inside other functions. An important detail of nested functions in JavaScript is that they can access variables in their parent function's scope: js function parentFunc() { const a = 1; function nestedFunc() { const b = 4; // parentFunc can't use this return a + b; } return nestedFunc(); // 5 } This provides a great deal of utility in writing more maintainable code. If a called function relies on one or two other functions that are not useful to any other part of your code, you can nest those utility functions inside it. This keeps the number of functions that are in the global scope down. This is also a great counter to the lure of global variables. When writing complex code, it is often tempting to use global variables to share values between multiple functions, which leads to code that is hard to maintain. Nested functions can share variables in their parent, so you can use that mechanism to couple functions together without polluting your global namespace. Classes JavaScript offers the class syntax that's very similar to languages like Java. js class Person { constructor(name) { this.name = name; } sayHello() { return `Hello, I'm ${this.name}!`; } } const p = new Person(\"Maria\"); console.log(p.sayHello()); JavaScript classes are just functions that must be instantiated with the new operator. Every time a class is instantiated, it returns an object containing the methods and properties that the class specified. Classes don't enforce any code organization â for example, you can have functions returning classes, or you can have multiple classes per file. Here's an example of how ad hoc the creation of a class can be: it's just an expression returned from an arrow function. This pattern is called a mixin . js const withAuthentication = (cls) => class extends cls { authenticate() { // â¦ } }; class Admin extends withAuthentication(Person) { // â¦ } Static properties are created by prepending static . Private fields and methods are created by prepending a hash # (not private ). The hash is an integral part of the element's name, and distinguishes it from a regular string-keyed property. (Think about # as _ in Python.) Unlike most other languages, there's absolutely no way to read a private element outside the class body â not even in derived classes. For a detailed guide on various class features, you can read the guide page . Asynchronous programming JavaScript is single-threaded by nature. There's no paralleling ; only concurrency . Asynchronous programming is powered by an event loop , which allows a set of tasks to be queued and polled for completion. There are three idiomatic ways to write asynchronous code in JavaScript: Callback-based (such as setTimeout() ) Promise -based async / await , which is a syntactic sugar for Promises For example, here's what a file-read operation might look like in JavaScript: js // Callback-based fs.readFile(filename, (err, content) => { // This callback is invoked when the file is read, which could be after a while if (err) { throw err; } console.log(content); }); // Code here will be executed while the file is waiting to be read // Promise-based fs.readFile(filename) .then((content) => { // What to do when the file is read console.log(content); }) .catch((err) => { throw err; }); // Code here will be executed while the file is waiting to be read // Async/await async function readFile(filename) { const content = await fs.readFile(filename); console.log(content); } The core language doesn't specify any asynchronous programming features, but it's crucial when interacting with the external environment â from asking user permissions , to fetching data , to reading files . Keeping the potentially long-running operations async ensures that other processes can still run while this one waits â for example, the browser will not freeze while waiting for the user to click a button to grant permission. If you have an async value, it's not possible to get its value synchronously. For example, if you have a promise, you can only access the eventual result via the then() method. Similarly, await can only be used in an async context, which is usually an async function or a module. Promises are never blocking â only the logic depending on the promise's result will be deferred; everything else continues to execute in the meantime. If you are a functional programmer, you may recognize promises as monads which can be mapped with then() (however, they are not proper monads because they auto-flatten; i.e., you can't have a Promise<Promise<T>> ). In fact, the single-threaded model has made Node.js a popular choice for server-side programming due to its non-blocking IO, making handling a large number of database or file-system requests very performant. However, CPU-bound (computationally intensive) tasks that are pure JavaScript will still block the main thread. To achieve real paralleling, you may need to use workers . To learn more about asynchronous programming, you can read about using promises or follow the asynchronous JavaScript tutorial. Modules JavaScript also specifies a module system supported by most runtimes. A module is usually a file, identified by its file path or URL. You can use the import and export statements to exchange data between modules: js import { foo } from \"./foo.js\"; // Unexported variables are local to the module const b = 2; export const a = 1; Unlike Haskell, Python, Java, etc., JavaScript module resolution is entirely host-defined â it's usually based on URLs or file paths, so relative file paths \"just work\" and are relative to the current module's path instead of some project root path. However, the JavaScript language doesn't offer standard library modules â all core functionalities are powered by global variables like Math and Intl instead. This is due to the long history of JavaScript lacking a module system, and the fact that opting into the module system involves some changes to the runtime setup. Different runtimes may use different module systems. For example, Node.js uses the package manager npm and is mostly file-system based, while Deno and browsers are fully URL-based and modules can be resolved from HTTP URLs. For more information, see the modules guide page . Language and runtime Throughout this page, we've constantly mentioned that certain features are language-level while others are runtime-level . JavaScript is a general-purpose scripting language. The core language specification focuses on pure computational logic. It doesn't deal with any input/output â in fact, without extra runtime-level APIs (most notably console.log() ), a JavaScript program's behavior is entirely unobservable. A runtime, or a host, is something that feeds data to the JavaScript engine (the interpreter), provides extra global properties, and provides hooks for the engine to interact with the outside world. Module resolution, reading data, printing messages, sending network requests, etc. are all runtime-level operations. Since its inception, JavaScript has been adopted in various environments, such as browsers (which provide APIs like DOM ), Node.js (which provides APIs like file system access ), etc. JavaScript has been successfully integrated in web (which was its primary purpose), mobile apps, desktop apps, server-side apps, serverless, embedded systems, and more. While you learn about JavaScript core features, it's also important to understand host-provided features in order to put the knowledge to use. For example, you can read about all web platform APIs , which are implemented by browsers, and sometimes non-browsers. Further exploration This page offers a very basic insight into how various JavaScript features compare with other languages. If you want to learn more about the language itself and the nuances of each feature, you can read the JavaScript guide and the JavaScript reference . There are some essential parts of the language that we have omitted due to space and complexity, but you can explore on your own: Inheritance and the prototype chain Closures Regular expressions Iteration Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on Oct 30, 2025 by MDN contributors .

      "text_content": "JavaScript data types and data structures Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but these often differ from one language to another. This article attempts to list the built-in data structures available in JavaScript and what properties they have. These can be used to build other data structures. The language overview offers a similar summary of the common data types, but with more comparisons to other languages. Dynamic and weak typing JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types . Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types: js let foo = 42; // foo is now a number foo = \"bar\"; // foo is now a string foo = true; // foo is now a boolean JavaScript is also a weakly typed language, which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors. js const foo = 42; // foo is a number const result = foo + \"1\"; // JavaScript coerces foo to a string, so it can be concatenated with the other operand console.log(result); // 421 Implicit coercions are very convenient, but can create subtle bugs when conversions happen where they are not expected, or where they are expected to happen in the other direction (for example, string to number instead of number to string). For symbols and BigInts , JavaScript has intentionally disallowed certain implicit type conversions. Primitive values All types except Object define immutable values represented directly at the lowest level of the language. We refer to values of these types as primitive values . All primitive types, except null , can be tested by the typeof operator. typeof null returns \"object\" , so one has to use === null to test for null . All primitive types, except null and undefined , have their corresponding object wrapper types, which provide useful methods for working with the primitive values. For example, the Number object provides methods like toExponential() . When a property is accessed on a primitive value, JavaScript automatically wraps the value into the corresponding wrapper object and accesses the property on the object instead. However, accessing a property on null or undefined throws a TypeError exception, which necessitates the introduction of the optional chaining operator. Type typeof return value Object wrapper Null \"object\" N/A Undefined \"undefined\" N/A Boolean \"boolean\" Boolean Number \"number\" Number BigInt \"bigint\" BigInt String \"string\" String Symbol \"symbol\" Symbol The object wrapper classes' reference pages contain more information about the methods and properties available for each type, as well as detailed descriptions for the semantics of the primitive types themselves. Null type The Null type is inhabited by exactly one value: null . Undefined type The Undefined type is inhabited by exactly one value: undefined . Conceptually, undefined indicates the absence of a value , while null indicates the absence of an object (which could also make up an excuse for typeof null === \"object\" ). The language usually defaults to undefined when something is devoid of a value: A return statement with no value ( return; ) implicitly returns undefined . Accessing a nonexistent object property ( obj.iDontExist ) returns undefined . A variable declaration without initialization ( let x; ) implicitly initializes the variable to undefined . Many methods, such as Array.prototype.find() and Map.prototype.get() , return undefined when no element is found. null is used much less often in the core language. The most important place is the end of the prototype chain â subsequently, methods that interact with prototypes, such as Object.getPrototypeOf() , Object.create() , etc., accept or return null instead of undefined . null is a keyword , but undefined is a normal identifier that happens to be a global property. In practice, the difference is minor, since undefined should not be redefined or shadowed. Boolean type The Boolean type represents a logical entity and is inhabited by two values: true and false . Boolean values are usually used for conditional operations, including ternary operators , if...else , while , etc. Number type The Number type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value . It is capable of storing positive floating-point numbers between 2 -1074 ( Number.MIN_VALUE ) and 2 1023 Ã (2 - 2 -52 ) ( Number.MAX_VALUE ) as well as negative floating-point numbers of the same magnitude, but it can only safely store integers in the range -(2 53 â 1) ( Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER ) to 2 53 â 1 ( Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER ). Outside this range, JavaScript can no longer safely represent integers; they will instead be represented by a double-precision floating point approximation. You can check if a number is within the range of safe integers using Number.isSafeInteger() . Values outside the representable range are automatically converted: Positive values greater than Number.MAX_VALUE are converted to Infinity . Positive values smaller than Number.MIN_VALUE are converted to 0 . Negative values smaller than - Number.MAX_VALUE are converted to -Infinity . Negative values greater than - Number.MIN_VALUE are converted to -0 . Infinity and -Infinity behave similarly to mathematical infinity, but with some slight differences; see Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY and Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY for details. The Number type has only one value with multiple representations: 0 is represented as both -0 and +0 (where 0 is an alias for +0 ). In practice, there is almost no difference between the different representations; for example, +0 === -0 is true . However, you are able to notice this when you divide by zero: js console.log(42 / +0); // Infinity console.log(42 / -0); // -Infinity NaN (\" N ot a N umber\") is a special kind of number value that's typically encountered when the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number. It is also the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself. Although a number is conceptually a \"mathematical value\" and is always implicitly floating-point-encoded, JavaScript provides bitwise operators . When applying bitwise operators, the number is first converted to a 32-bit integer. Note: Although bitwise operators can be used to represent several Boolean values within a single number using bit masking , this is usually considered a bad practice. JavaScript offers other means to represent a set of Booleans (like an array of Booleans, or an object with Boolean values assigned to named properties). Bit masking also tends to make the code more difficult to read, understand, and maintain. It may be necessary to use such techniques in very constrained environments, like when trying to cope with the limitations of local storage, or in extreme cases (such as when each bit over the network counts). This technique should only be considered when it is the last measure that can be taken to optimize size. BigInt type The BigInt type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary magnitude. With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit ( Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER ) for Numbers. A BigInt is created by appending n to the end of an integer or by calling the BigInt() function. This example demonstrates where incrementing the Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER returns the expected result: js // BigInt const x = BigInt(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER); // 9007199254740991n x + 1n === x + 2n; // false because 9007199254740992n and 9007199254740993n are unequal // Number Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER + 1 === Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER + 2; // true because both are 9007199254740992 You can use most operators to work with BigInts, including + , * , - , ** , and % â the only forbidden one is >>> . A BigInt is not strictly equal to a Number with the same mathematical value, but it is loosely so. BigInt values are neither always more precise nor always less precise than numbers, since BigInts cannot represent fractional numbers, but can represent big integers more accurately. Neither type entails the other, and they are not mutually substitutable. A TypeError is thrown if BigInt values are mixed with regular numbers in arithmetic expressions, or if they are implicitly converted to each other. String type The String type represents textual data and is encoded as a sequence of 16-bit unsigned integer values representing UTF-16 code units . Each element in the string occupies a position in the string. The first element is at index 0 , the next at index 1 , and so on. The length of a string is the number of UTF-16 code units in it, which may not correspond to the actual number of Unicode characters; see the String reference page for more details. JavaScript strings are immutable. This means that once a string is created, it is not possible to modify it. String methods create new strings based on the content of the current string â for example: A substring of the original using substring() . A concatenation of two strings using the concatenation operator ( + ) or concat() . Beware of \"stringly-typing\" your code! It can be tempting to use strings to represent complex data. Doing this comes with short-term benefits: It is easy to build complex strings with concatenation. Strings are easy to debug (what you see printed is always what is in the string). Strings are the common denominator of a lot of APIs ( input fields , local storage values, fetch() responses when using Response.text() , etc.) and it can be tempting to only work with strings. With conventions, it is possible to represent any data structure in a string. This does not make it a good idea. For instance, with a separator, one could emulate a list (while a JavaScript array would be more suitable). Unfortunately, when the separator is used in one of the \"list\" elements, then, the list is broken. An escape character can be chosen, etc. All of this requires conventions and creates an unnecessary maintenance burden. Use strings for textual data. When representing complex data, parse strings, and use the appropriate abstraction. Symbol type A Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value and may be used as the key of an Object property (see below). In some programming languages, Symbols are called \"atoms\". The purpose of symbols is to create unique property keys that are guaranteed not to clash with keys from other code. Objects In computer science, an object is a value in memory which is possibly referenced by an identifier . In JavaScript, objects are the only mutable values. Functions are, in fact, also objects with the additional capability of being callable . Properties In JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of properties. With the object literal syntax , a limited set of properties are initialized; then properties can be added and removed. Object properties are equivalent to key-value pairs. Property keys are either strings or symbols . When other types (such as numbers) are used to index objects, the values are implicitly converted to strings. Property values can be values of any type, including other objects, which enables building complex data structures. There are two types of object properties: The data property and the accessor property . Each property has corresponding attributes . Each attribute is accessed internally by the JavaScript engine, but you can set them through Object.defineProperty() , or read them through Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor() . You can read more about the various nuances on the Object.defineProperty() page. Data property Data properties associate a key with a value. It can be described by the following attributes: value The value retrieved by a get access of the property. Can be any JavaScript value. writable A boolean value indicating if the property can be changed with an assignment. enumerable A boolean value indicating if the property can be enumerated by a for...in loop. See also Enumerability and ownership of properties for how enumerability interacts with other functions and syntaxes. configurable A boolean value indicating if the property can be deleted, can be changed to an accessor property, and can have its attributes changed. Accessor property Associates a key with one of two accessor functions ( get and set ) to retrieve or store a value. Note: It's important to recognize it's accessor property â not accessor method . We can give a JavaScript object class-like accessors by using a function as a value â but that doesn't make the object a class. An accessor property has the following attributes: get A function called with an empty argument list to retrieve the property value whenever a get access to the value is performed. See also getters . May be undefined . set A function called with an argument that contains the assigned value. Executed whenever a specified property is attempted to be changed. See also setters . May be undefined . enumerable A boolean value indicating if the property can be enumerated by a for...in loop. See also Enumerability and ownership of properties for how enumerability interacts with other functions and syntaxes. configurable A boolean value indicating if the property can be deleted, can be changed to a data property, and can have its attributes changed. The prototype of an object points to another object or to null â it's conceptually a hidden property of the object, commonly represented as [[Prototype]] . Properties of the object's [[Prototype]] can also be accessed on the object itself. Objects are ad-hoc key-value pairs, so they are often used as maps. However, there can be ergonomics, security, and performance issues. Use a Map for storing arbitrary data instead. The Map reference contains a more detailed discussion of the pros & cons between plain objects and maps for storing key-value associations. Dates JavaScript provides two sets of APIs for representing dates: the legacy Date object and the modern Temporal object. Date has many undesirable design choices and should be avoided in new code if possible. Indexed collections: Arrays and typed Arrays Arrays are regular objects for which there is a particular relationship between integer-keyed properties and the length property. Additionally, arrays inherit from Array.prototype , which provides a handful of convenient methods to manipulate arrays. For example, indexOf() searches a value in the array and push() appends an element to the array. This makes Arrays a perfect candidate to represent ordered lists. Typed Arrays present an array-like view of an underlying binary data buffer, and offer many methods that have similar semantics to the array counterparts. \"Typed array\" is an umbrella term for a range of data structures, including Int8Array , Float32Array , etc. Check the typed array page for more information. Typed arrays are often used in conjunction with ArrayBuffer and DataView . Keyed collections: Maps, Sets, WeakMaps, WeakSets These data structures take object references as keys. Set and WeakSet represent a collection of unique values, while Map and WeakMap represent a collection of key-value associations. You could implement Map s and Set s yourself. However, since objects cannot be compared (in the sense of < \"less than\", for instance), neither does the engine expose its hash function for objects, look-up performance would necessarily be linear. Native implementations of them (including WeakMap s) can have look-up performance that is approximately logarithmic to constant time. Usually, to bind data to a DOM node, one could set properties directly on the object, or use data-* attributes. This has the downside that the data is available to any script running in the same context. Map s and WeakMap s make it easy to privately bind data to an object. WeakMap and WeakSet only allow garbage-collectable values as keys, which are either objects or non-registered symbols , and the keys may be collected even when they remain in the collection. They are specifically used for memory usage optimization . Structured data: JSON JSON ( J ava S cript O bject N otation) is a lightweight data-interchange format, derived from JavaScript, but used by many programming languages. JSON builds universal data structures that can be transferred between different environments and even across languages. See JSON for more details. More objects in the standard library JavaScript has a standard library of built-in objects. Read the reference to find out more about the built-in objects. Type coercion As mentioned above, JavaScript is a weakly typed language. This means that you can often use a value of one type where another type is expected, and the language will convert it to the right type for you. To do so, JavaScript defines a handful of coercion rules. Primitive coercion The primitive coercion process is used where a primitive value is expected, but there's no strong preference for what the actual type should be. This is usually when a string , a number , or a BigInt are equally acceptable. For example: The Date() constructor, when it receives one argument that's not a Date instance â strings represent date strings, while numbers represent timestamps. The + operator â if one operand is a string, string concatenation is performed; otherwise, numeric addition is performed. The == operator â if one operand is a primitive while the other is an object, the object is converted to a primitive value with no preferred type. This operation does not do any conversion if the value is already a primitive. Objects are converted to primitives by calling its [Symbol.toPrimitive]() (with \"default\" as hint), valueOf() , and toString() methods, in that order. Note that primitive conversion calls valueOf() before toString() , which is similar to the behavior of number coercion but different from string coercion . The [Symbol.toPrimitive]() method, if present, must return a primitive â returning an object results in a TypeError . For valueOf() and toString() , if one returns an object, the return value is ignored and the other's return value is used instead; if neither is present, or neither returns a primitive, a TypeError is thrown. For example, in the following code: js console.log({} + []); // \"[object Object]\" Neither {} nor [] have a [Symbol.toPrimitive]() method. Both {} and [] inherit valueOf() from Object.prototype.valueOf , which returns the object itself. Since the return value is an object, it is ignored. Therefore, toString() is called instead. {}.toString() returns \"[object Object]\" , while [].toString() returns \"\" , so the result is their concatenation: \"[object Object]\" . The [Symbol.toPrimitive]() method always takes precedence when doing conversion to any primitive type. Primitive conversion generally behaves like number conversion, because valueOf() is called in priority; however, objects with custom [Symbol.toPrimitive]() methods can choose to return any primitive. Date and Symbol objects are the only built-in objects that override the [Symbol.toPrimitive]() method. Date.prototype[Symbol.toPrimitive]() treats the \"default\" hint as if it's \"string\" , while Symbol.prototype[Symbol.toPrimitive]() ignores the hint and always returns a symbol. Numeric coercion There are two numeric types: Number and BigInt . Sometimes the language specifically expects a number or a BigInt (such as Array.prototype.slice() , where the index must be a number); other times, it may tolerate either and perform different operations depending on the operand's type. For strict coercion processes that do not allow implicit conversion from the other type, see number coercion and BigInt coercion . Numeric coercion is nearly the same as number coercion , except that BigInts are returned as-is instead of causing a TypeError . Numeric coercion is used by all arithmetic operators, since they are overloaded for both numbers and BigInts. The only exception is unary plus , which always does number coercion. Other coercions All data types, except Null, Undefined, and Symbol, have their respective coercion process. See string coercion , boolean coercion , and object coercion for more details. As you may have noticed, there are three distinct paths through which objects may be converted to primitives: Primitive coercion : [Symbol.toPrimitive](\"default\") â valueOf() â toString() Numeric coercion , number coercion , BigInt coercion : [Symbol.toPrimitive](\"number\") â valueOf() â toString() String coercion : [Symbol.toPrimitive](\"string\") â toString() â valueOf() In all cases, [Symbol.toPrimitive]() , if present, must be callable and return a primitive, while valueOf or toString will be ignored if they are not callable or return an object. At the end of the process, if successful, the result is guaranteed to be a primitive. The resulting primitive is then subject to further coercions depending on the context.

      "text_content": "Equality comparisons and sameness JavaScript provides three different value-comparison operations: === â strict equality (triple equals) == â loose equality (double equals) Object.is() Which operation you choose depends on what sort of comparison you are looking to perform. Briefly: Double equals ( == ) will perform a type conversion when comparing two things, and will handle NaN , -0 , and +0 specially to conform to IEEE 754 (so NaN != NaN , and -0 == +0 ); Triple equals ( === ) will do the same comparison as double equals (including the special handling for NaN , -0 , and +0 ) but without type conversion; if the types differ, false is returned. Object.is() does no type conversion and no special handling for NaN , -0 , and +0 (giving it the same behavior as === except on those special numeric values). They correspond to three of four equality algorithms in JavaScript: IsLooselyEqual : == IsStrictlyEqual : === SameValue : Object.is() SameValueZero : used by many built-in operations Note that the distinction between these all have to do with their handling of primitives; none of them compares whether the parameters are conceptually similar in structure. For any non-primitive objects x and y which have the same structure but are distinct objects themselves, all of the above forms will evaluate to false . Strict equality using === Strict equality compares two values for equality. Neither value is implicitly converted to some other value before being compared. If the values have different types, the values are considered unequal. If the values have the same type, are not numbers, and have the same value, they're considered equal. Finally, if both values are numbers, they're considered equal if they're both not NaN and are the same value, or if one is +0 and one is -0 . js const num = 0; const obj = new String(\"0\"); const str = \"0\"; console.log(num === num); // true console.log(obj === obj); // true console.log(str === str); // true console.log(num === obj); // false console.log(num === str); // false console.log(obj === str); // false console.log(null === undefined); // false console.log(obj === null); // false console.log(obj === undefined); // false Strict equality is almost always the correct comparison operation to use. For all values except numbers, it uses the obvious semantics: a value is only equal to itself. For numbers it uses slightly different semantics to gloss over two different edge cases. The first is that floating point zero is either positively or negatively signed. This is useful in representing certain mathematical solutions, but as most situations don't care about the difference between +0 and -0 , strict equality treats them as the same value. The second is that floating point includes the concept of a not-a-number value, NaN , to represent the solution to certain ill-defined mathematical problems: negative infinity added to positive infinity, for example. Strict equality treats NaN as unequal to every other value â including itself. (The only case in which (x !== x) is true is when x is NaN .) Besides === , strict equality is also used by array index-finding methods including Array.prototype.indexOf() , Array.prototype.lastIndexOf() , TypedArray.prototype.indexOf() , TypedArray.prototype.lastIndexOf() , and case -matching. This means you cannot use indexOf(NaN) to find the index of a NaN value in an array, or use NaN as a case value in a switch statement and make it match anything. js console.log([NaN].indexOf(NaN)); // -1 switch (NaN) { case NaN: console.log(\"Surprise\"); // Nothing is logged } Loose equality using == Loose equality is symmetric : A == B always has identical semantics to B == A for any values of A and B (except for the order of applied conversions). The behavior for performing loose equality using == is as follows: If the operands have the same type, they are compared as follows: Object: return true only if both operands reference the same object. String: return true only if both operands have the same characters in the same order. Number: return true only if both operands have the same value. +0 and -0 are treated as the same value. If either operand is NaN , return false ; so NaN is never equal to NaN . Boolean: return true only if operands are both true or both false . BigInt: return true only if both operands have the same value. Symbol: return true only if both operands reference the same symbol. If one of the operands is null or undefined , the other must also be null or undefined to return true . Otherwise return false . If one of the operands is an object and the other is a primitive, convert the object to a primitive . At this step, both operands are converted to primitives (one of String, Number, Boolean, Symbol, and BigInt). The rest of the conversion is done case-by-case. If they are of the same type, compare them using step 1. If one of the operands is a Symbol but the other is not, return false . If one of the operands is a Boolean but the other is not, convert the boolean to a number : true is converted to 1, and false is converted to 0. Then compare the two operands loosely again. Number to String: convert the string to a number . Conversion failure results in NaN , which will guarantee the equality to be false . Number to BigInt: compare by their mathematical value. If the number is Â±Infinity or NaN , return false . String to BigInt: convert the string to a BigInt using the same algorithm as the BigInt() constructor. If conversion fails, return false . Traditionally, and according to ECMAScript, all primitives and objects are loosely unequal to undefined and null . But most browsers permit a very narrow class of objects (specifically, the document.all object for any page), in some contexts, to act as if they emulate the value undefined . Loose equality is one such context: null == A and undefined == A evaluate to true if, and only if, A is an object that emulates undefined . In all other cases an object is never loosely equal to undefined or null . In most cases, using loose equality is discouraged. The result of a comparison using strict equality is easier to predict, and may evaluate more quickly due to the lack of type coercion. The following example demonstrates loose equality comparisons involving the number primitive 0 , the bigint primitive 0n , the string primitive '0' , and an object whose toString() value is '0' . js const num = 0; const big = 0n; const str = \"0\"; const obj = new String(\"0\"); console.log(num == str); // true console.log(big == num); // true console.log(str == big); // true console.log(num == obj); // true console.log(big == obj); // true console.log(str == obj); // true Loose equality is only used by the == operator. Same-value equality using Object.is() Same-value equality determines whether two values are functionally identical in all contexts. (This use case demonstrates an instance of the Liskov substitution principle .) One instance occurs when an attempt is made to mutate an immutable property: js // Add an immutable NEGATIVE_ZERO property to the Number constructor. Object.defineProperty(Number, \"NEGATIVE_ZERO\", { value: -0, writable: false, configurable: false, enumerable: false, }); function attemptMutation(v) { Object.defineProperty(Number, \"NEGATIVE_ZERO\", { value: v }); } Object.defineProperty will throw an exception when attempting to change an immutable property, but it does nothing if no actual change is requested. If v is -0 , no change has been requested, and no error will be thrown. Internally, when an immutable property is redefined, the newly-specified value is compared against the current value using same-value equality. Same-value equality is provided by the Object.is method. It's used almost everywhere in the language where a value of equivalent identity is expected. Same-value-zero equality Similar to same-value equality, but +0 and -0 are considered equal. Same-value-zero equality is not exposed as a JavaScript API, but can be implemented with custom code: js function sameValueZero(x, y) { if (typeof x === \"number\" && typeof y === \"number\") { // x and y are equal (may be -0 and 0) or they are both NaN return x === y || (x !== x && y !== y); } return x === y; } Same-value-zero only differs from strict equality by treating NaN as equivalent, and only differs from same-value equality by treating -0 as equivalent to 0 . This makes it usually have the most sensible behavior during searching, especially when working with NaN . It's used by Array.prototype.includes() , TypedArray.prototype.includes() , as well as Map and Set methods for comparing key equality. Comparing equality methods People often compare double equals and triple equals by saying one is an \"enhanced\" version of the other. For example, double equals could be said as an extended version of triple equals, because the former does everything that the latter does, but with type conversion on its operands â for example, 6 == \"6\" . Alternatively, it can be claimed that double equals is the baseline, and triple equals is an enhanced version, because it requires the two operands to be the same type, so it adds an extra constraint. However, this way of thinking implies that the equality comparisons form a one-dimensional \"spectrum\" where \"totally strict\" lies on one end and \"totally loose\" lies on the other. This model falls short with Object.is , because it isn't \"looser\" than double equals or \"stricter\" than triple equals, nor does it fit somewhere in between (i.e., being both stricter than double equals, but looser than triple equals). We can see from the sameness comparisons table below that this is due to the way that Object.is handles NaN . Notice that if Object.is(NaN, NaN) evaluated to false , we could say that it fits on the loose/strict spectrum as an even stricter form of triple equals, one that distinguishes between -0 and +0 . The NaN handling means this is untrue, however. Unfortunately, Object.is has to be thought of in terms of its specific characteristics, rather than its looseness or strictness with regard to the equality operators. x y == === Object.is SameValueZero undefined undefined â true â true â true â true null null â true â true â true â true true true â true â true â true â true false false â true â true â true â true 'foo' 'foo' â true â true â true â true 0 0 â true â true â true â true +0 -0 â true â true â false â true +0 0 â true â true â true â true -0 0 â true â true â false â true 0n -0n â true â true â true â true 0 false â true â false â false â false \"\" false â true â false â false â false \"\" 0 â true â false â false â false '0' 0 â true â false â false â false '17' 17 â true â false â false â false [1, 2] '1,2' â true â false â false â false new String('foo') 'foo' â true â false â false â false null undefined â true â false â false â false null false â false â false â false â false undefined false â false â false â false â false { foo: 'bar' } { foo: 'bar' } â false â false â false â false new String('foo') new String('foo') â false â false â false â false 0 null â false â false â false â false 0 NaN â false â false â false â false 'foo' NaN â false â false â false â false NaN NaN â false â false â true â true When to use Object.is() versus triple equals In general, the only time Object.is 's special behavior towards zeros is likely to be of interest is in the pursuit of certain meta-programming schemes, especially regarding property descriptors, when it is desirable for your work to mirror some of the characteristics of Object.defineProperty . If your use case does not require this, it is suggested to avoid Object.is and use === instead. Even if your requirements involve having comparisons between two NaN values evaluate to true , generally it is easier to special-case the NaN checks (using the isNaN method available from previous versions of ECMAScript) than it is to work out how surrounding computations might affect the sign of any zeros you encounter in your comparison. Here's a non-exhaustive list of built-in methods and operators that might cause a distinction between -0 and +0 to manifest itself in your code: - (unary negation) Consider the following example: js const stoppingForce = obj.mass * -obj.velocity; If obj.velocity is 0 (or computes to 0 ), a -0 is introduced at that place and propagates out into stoppingForce . Math.atan2 , Math.ceil , Math.pow , Math.round In some cases, it's possible for a -0 to be introduced into an expression as a return value of these methods even when no -0 exists as one of the parameters. For example, using Math.pow to raise -Infinity to the power of any negative, odd exponent evaluates to -0 . Refer to the documentation for the individual methods. Math.floor , Math.max , Math.min , Math.sin , Math.sqrt , Math.tan It's possible to get a -0 return value out of these methods in some cases where a -0 exists as one of the parameters. E.g., Math.min(-0, +0) evaluates to -0 . Refer to the documentation for the individual methods. ~ , << , >> Each of these operators uses the ToInt32 algorithm internally. Since there is only one representation for 0 in the internal 32-bit integer type, -0 will not survive a round trip after an inverse operation. E.g., both Object.is(~~(-0), -0) and Object.is(-0 << 2 >> 2, -0) evaluate to false . Relying on Object.is when the sign of zeros is not taken into account can be hazardous. Of course, when the intent is to distinguish between -0 and +0 , it does exactly what's desired. Caveat: Object.is() and NaN The Object.is specification treats all instances of NaN as the same object. However, since typed arrays are available, we can have distinct floating point representations of NaN which don't behave identically in all contexts. For example: js const f2b = (x) => new Uint8Array(new Float64Array([x]).buffer); const b2f = (x) => new Float64Array(x.buffer)[0]; // Get a byte representation of NaN const n = f2b(NaN); // Change the first bit, which is the sign bit and doesn't matter for NaN n[0] = 1; const nan2 = b2f(n); console.log(nan2); // NaN console.log(Object.is(nan2, NaN)); // true console.log(f2b(NaN)); // Uint8Array(8) [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 248, 127] console.log(f2b(nan2)); // Uint8Array(8) [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 248, 127] See also JS Comparison Table by dorey Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on Jul 8, 2025 by MDN contributors .

Itâs been available across browsers since September 2015. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The Object.is() static method determines whether two values are the same value . Try it console.log(Object.is(\"1\", 1)); // Expected output: false console.log(Object.is(NaN, NaN)); // Expected output: true console.log(Object.is(-0, 0)); // Expected output: false const obj = {}; console.log(Object.is(obj, {})); // Expected output: false Syntax js Object.is(value1, value2) Parameters value1 The first value to compare. value2 The second value to compare. Return value A boolean indicating whether or not the two arguments are the same value. Description Object.is() determines whether two values are the same value . Two values are the same if one of the following holds: both undefined both null both true or both false both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order both the same object (meaning both values reference the same object in memory) both BigInts with the same numeric value both symbols that reference the same symbol value both numbers and both +0 both -0 both NaN or both non-zero, not NaN , and have the same value Object.is() is not equivalent to the == operator. The == operator applies various coercions to both sides (if they are not the same type) before testing for equality (resulting in such behavior as \"\" == false being true ), but Object.is() doesn't coerce either value. Object.is() is also not equivalent to the === operator. The only difference between Object.is() and === is in their treatment of signed zeros and NaN values. The === operator (and the == operator) treats the number values -0 and +0 as equal, but treats NaN as not equal to each other. Examples Using Object.is() js // Case 1: Evaluation result is the same as using === Object.is(25, 25); // true Object.is(\"foo\", \"foo\"); // true Object.is(\"foo\", \"bar\"); // false Object.is(null, null); // true Object.is(undefined, undefined); // true Object.is(window, window); // true Object.is([], []); // false const foo = { a: 1 }; const bar = { a: 1 }; const sameFoo = foo; Object.is(foo, foo); // true Object.is(foo, bar); // false Object.is(foo, sameFoo); // true // Case 2: Signed zero Object.is(0, -0); // false Object.is(+0, -0); // false Object.is(-0, -0); // true // Case 3: NaN Object.is(NaN, 0 / 0); // true Object.is(NaN, Number.NaN); // true Specifications Specification ECMAScriptÂ® 2026 LanguageÂ Specification # sec-object.is Browser compatibility See also Polyfill of Object.is in core-js es-shims polyfill of Object.is Equality comparisons and sameness Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on Jul 10, 2025 by MDN contributors .

      "text_content": "Enumerability and ownership of properties Every property in JavaScript objects can be classified by three factors: Enumerable or non-enumerable; String or symbol ; Own property or inherited property from the prototype chain. Enumerable properties are those properties whose internal enumerable flag is set to true, which is the default for properties created via simple assignment or via a property initializer. Properties defined via Object.defineProperty and such are not enumerable by default. Most iteration means (such as for...in loops and Object.keys ) only visit enumerable keys. Ownership of properties is determined by whether the property belongs to the object directly and not to its prototype chain. All properties, enumerable or not, string or symbol, own or inherited, can be accessed with dot notation or bracket notation . In this section, we will focus on the means provided by JavaScript to visit a group of object properties one-by-one. Querying object properties There are four built-in ways to query a property of an object. They all support both string and symbol keys. The following table summarizes when each method returns true . Enumerable, own Enumerable, inherited Non-enumerable, own Non-enumerable, inherited propertyIsEnumerable() true â false â false â false â hasOwnProperty() true â false â true â false â Object.hasOwn() true â false â true â false â in true â true â true â true â Traversing object properties There are many methods in JavaScript that traverse a group of properties of an object. Sometimes, these properties are returned as an array; sometimes, they are iterated one-by-one in a loop; sometimes, they are used for constructing or mutating another object. The following table summarizes when a property may be visited. Methods that only visit string properties or only symbol properties will have an extra note. â means a property of this type will be visited; â means it will not. Enumerable, own Enumerable, inherited Non-enumerable, own Non-enumerable, inherited Object.keys Object.values Object.entries â (strings) â â â Object.getOwnPropertyNames â (strings) â â (strings) â Object.getOwnPropertySymbols â (symbols) â â (symbols) â Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors â â â â Reflect.ownKeys â â â â for...in â (strings) â (strings) â â Object.assign (After the first parameter) â â â â Object spread â â â â Obtaining properties by enumerability/ownership Note that this is not the most efficient algorithm for all cases, but useful for a quick demonstration. Detection can occur by SimplePropertyRetriever.theGetMethodYouWant(obj).includes(prop) Iteration can occur by SimplePropertyRetriever.theGetMethodYouWant(obj).forEach((value, prop) => {}); (or use filter() , map() , etc.) js const SimplePropertyRetriever = { getOwnEnumProps(obj) { return this._getPropertyNames(obj, true, false, this._enumerable); // Or could use for...in filtered with Object.hasOwn or just this: return Object.keys(obj); }, getOwnNonEnumProps(obj) { return this._getPropertyNames(obj, true, false, this._notEnumerable); }, getOwnProps(obj) { return this._getPropertyNames( obj, true, false, this._enumerableAndNotEnumerable, ); // Or just use: return Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj); }, getPrototypeEnumProps(obj) { return this._getPropertyNames(obj, false, true, this._enumerable); }, getPrototypeNonEnumProps(obj) { return this._getPropertyNames(obj, false, true, this._notEnumerable); }, getPrototypeProps(obj) { return this._getPropertyNames( obj, false, true, this._enumerableAndNotEnumerable, ); }, getOwnAndPrototypeEnumProps(obj) { return this._getPropertyNames(obj, true, true, this._enumerable); // Or could use unfiltered for...in }, getOwnAndPrototypeNonEnumProps(obj) { return this._getPropertyNames(obj, true, true, this._notEnumerable); }, getOwnAndPrototypeEnumAndNonEnumProps(obj) { return this._getPropertyNames( obj, true, true, this._enumerableAndNotEnumerable, ); }, // Private static property checker callbacks _enumerable(obj, prop) { return Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(obj, prop); }, _notEnumerable(obj, prop) { return !Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(obj, prop); }, _enumerableAndNotEnumerable(obj, prop) { return true; }, // Inspired by http://stackoverflow.com/a/8024294/271577 _getPropertyNames(obj, iterateSelf, iteratePrototype, shouldInclude) { const props = []; do { if (iterateSelf) { Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj).forEach((prop) => { if (props.indexOf(prop) === -1 && shouldInclude(obj, prop)) { props.push(prop); } }); } if (!iteratePrototype) { break; } iterateSelf = true; obj = Object.getPrototypeOf(obj); } while (obj); return props; }, }; See also in for...in Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty() Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable() Object.getOwnPropertyNames() Object.getOwnPropertySymbols() Object.keys() Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors() Object.hasOwn() Reflect.ownKeys() Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on Jul 8, 2025 by MDN contributors .

      "text_content": "Closures A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment ). In other words, a closure gives a function access to its outer scope. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time. Lexical scoping Consider the following example code: js function init() { var name = \"Mozilla\"; // name is a local variable created by init function displayName() { // displayName() is the inner function, that forms a closure console.log(name); // use variable declared in the parent function } displayName(); } init(); init() creates a local variable called name and a function called displayName() . The displayName() function is an inner function that is defined inside init() and is available only within the body of the init() function. Note that the displayName() function has no local variables of its own. However, since inner functions have access to the variables of outer scopes, displayName() can access the variable name declared in the parent function, init() . If you run this code in your console, you can see that the console.log() statement within the displayName() function successfully displays the value of the name variable, which is declared in its parent function. This is an example of lexical scoping , which describes how a parser resolves variable names when functions are nested. The word lexical refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available. Nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope. Scoping with let and const Traditionally (before ES6), JavaScript variables only had two kinds of scopes: function scope and global scope . Variables declared with var are either function-scoped or global-scoped, depending on whether they are declared within a function or outside a function. This can be tricky, because blocks with curly braces do not create scopes: js if (Math.random() > 0.5) { var x = 1; } else { var x = 2; } console.log(x); For people from other languages (e.g., C, Java) where blocks create scopes, the above code should throw an error on the console.log line, because we are outside the scope of x in either block. However, because blocks don't create scopes for var , the var statements here actually create a global variable. There is also a practical example introduced below that illustrates how this can cause actual bugs when combined with closures. In ES6, JavaScript introduced the let and const declarations, which, among other things like temporal dead zones , allow you to create block-scoped variables. js if (Math.random() > 0.5) { const x = 1; } else { const x = 2; } console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined In essence, blocks are finally treated as scopes in ES6, but only if you declare variables with let or const . In addition, ES6 introduced modules , which introduced another kind of scope. Closures are able to capture variables in all these scopes, which we will introduce later. Closure Consider the following code example: js function makeFunc() { const name = \"Mozilla\"; function displayName() { console.log(name); } return displayName; } const myFunc = makeFunc(); myFunc(); Running this code has exactly the same effect as the previous example of the init() function above. What's different (and interesting) is that the displayName() inner function is returned from the outer function before being executed . At first glance, it might seem unintuitive that this code still works. In some programming languages, the local variables within a function exist for just the duration of that function's execution. Once makeFunc() finishes executing, you might expect that the name variable would no longer be accessible. However, because the code still works, this is obviously not the case in JavaScript. The reason is that functions in JavaScript form closures. A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This environment consists of any variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created. In this case, myFunc is a reference to the instance of the function displayName that is created when makeFunc is run. The instance of displayName maintains a reference to its lexical environment, within which the variable name exists. For this reason, when myFunc is invoked, the variable name remains available for use, and \"Mozilla\" is passed to console.log . Here's a slightly more interesting exampleâa makeAdder function: js function makeAdder(x) { return function (y) { return x + y; }; } const add5 = makeAdder(5); const add10 = makeAdder(10); console.log(add5(2)); // 7 console.log(add10(2)); // 12 In this example, we have defined a function makeAdder(x) , that takes a single argument x , and returns a new function. The function it returns takes a single argument y , and returns the sum of x and y . In essence, makeAdder is a function factory. It creates functions that can add a specific value to their argument. In the above example, the function factory creates two new functionsâone that adds five to its argument, and one that adds 10. add5 and add10 both form closures. They share the same function body definition, but store different lexical environments. In add5 's lexical environment, x is 5, while in the lexical environment for add10 , x is 10. Practical closures Closures are useful because they let you associate data (the lexical environment) with a function that operates on that data. This has obvious parallels to object-oriented programming, where objects allow you to associate data (the object's properties) with one or more methods. Consequently, you can use a closure anywhere that you might normally use an object with only a single method. Situations where you might want to do this are particularly common on the web. Much of the code written in front-end JavaScript is event-based. You define some behavior, and then attach it to an event that is triggered by the user (such as a click or a keypress). The code is attached as a callback (a single function that is executed in response to the event). For instance, suppose we want to add buttons to a page to adjust the text size. One way of doing this is to specify the font-size of the body element (in pixels), and then set the size of the other elements on the page (such as headers) using the relative em unit: css body { font-family: \"Helvetica\", \"Arial\", sans-serif; font-size: 12px; } h1 { font-size: 1.5em; } h2 { font-size: 1.2em; } Such interactive text size buttons can change the font-size property of the body element, and the adjustments are picked up by other elements on the page thanks to the relative units. Here's the JavaScript: js function makeSizer(size) { return () => { document.body.style.fontSize = `${size}px`; }; } const size12 = makeSizer(12); const size14 = makeSizer(14); const size16 = makeSizer(16); size12 , size14 , and size16 are now functions that resize the body text to 12, 14, and 16 pixels, respectively. You can attach them to buttons as demonstrated in the following code example. js document.getElementById(\"size-12\").onclick = size12; document.getElementById(\"size-14\").onclick = size14; document.getElementById(\"size-16\").onclick = size16; html <button id=\"size-12\">12</button> <button id=\"size-14\">14</button> <button id=\"size-16\">16</button> <p>This is some text that will change size when you click the buttons above.</p> Emulating private methods with closures Languages such as Java allow you to declare methods as private, meaning that they can be called only by other methods in the same class. JavaScript, prior to classes , didn't have a native way of declaring private methods , but it was possible to emulate private methods using closures. Private methods aren't just useful for restricting access to code. They also provide a powerful way of managing your global namespace. The following code illustrates how to use closures to define public functions that can access private functions and variables. Note that these closures follow the Module Design Pattern . js const counter = (function () { let privateCounter = 0; function changeBy(val) { privateCounter += val; } return { increment() { changeBy(1); }, decrement() { changeBy(-1); }, value() { return privateCounter; }, }; })(); console.log(counter.value()); // 0. counter.increment(); counter.increment(); console.log(counter.value()); // 2. counter.decrement(); console.log(counter.value()); // 1. In previous examples, each closure had its own lexical environment. Here though, there is a single lexical environment that is shared by the three functions: counter.increment , counter.decrement , and counter.value . The shared lexical environment is created in the body of an anonymous function, which is executed as soon as it has been defined (also known as an IIFE ). The lexical environment contains two private items: a variable called privateCounter , and a function called changeBy . You can't access either of these private members from outside the anonymous function. Instead, you indirectly access them using the three public functions that are returned from the anonymous wrapper. Those three public functions form closures that share the same lexical environment. Thanks to JavaScript's lexical scoping, they each have access to the privateCounter variable and the changeBy function. js function makeCounter() { let privateCounter = 0; function changeBy(val) { privateCounter += val; } return { increment() { changeBy(1); }, decrement() { changeBy(-1); }, value() { return privateCounter; }, }; } const counter1 = makeCounter(); const counter2 = makeCounter(); console.log(counter1.value()); // 0. counter1.increment(); counter1.increment(); console.log(counter1.value()); // 2. counter1.decrement(); console.log(counter1.value()); // 1. console.log(counter2.value()); // 0. Notice how the two counters maintain their independence from one another. Each closure references a different version of the privateCounter variable through its own closure. Each time one of the counters is called, its lexical environment changes by changing the value of this variable. Changes to the variable value in one closure don't affect the value in the other closure. Note: Using closures in this way provides benefits that are normally associated with object-oriented programming. In particular, data hiding and encapsulation . Closure scope chain A nested function's access to the outer function's scope includes the enclosing scope of the outer functionâeffectively creating a chain of function scopes. To demonstrate, consider the following example code. js // global scope const e = 10; function sum(a) { return function (b) { return function (c) { // outer functions scope return function (d) { // local scope return a + b + c + d + e; }; }; }; } console.log(sum(1)(2)(3)(4)); // 20 You can also write without anonymous functions: js // global scope const e = 10; function sum(a) { return function sum2(b) { return function sum3(c) { // outer functions scope return function sum4(d) { // local scope return a + b + c + d + e; }; }; }; } const sum2 = sum(1); const sum3 = sum2(2); const sum4 = sum3(3); const result = sum4(4); console.log(result); // 20 In the example above, there's a series of nested functions, all of which have access to the outer functions' scope. In this context, we can say that closures have access to all outer scopes. Closures can capture variables in block scopes and module scopes as well. For example, the following creates a closure over the block-scoped variable y : js function outer() { let getY; { const y = 6; getY = () => y; } console.log(typeof y); // undefined console.log(getY()); // 6 } outer(); Closures over modules can be more interesting. js // myModule.js let x = 5; export const getX = () => x; export const setX = (val) => { x = val; }; Here, the module exports a pair of getter-setter functions, which close over the module-scoped variable x . Even when x is not directly accessible from other modules, it can be read and written with the functions. js import { getX, setX } from \"./myModule.js\"; console.log(getX()); // 5 setX(6); console.log(getX()); // 6 Closures can close over imported values as well, which are regarded as live bindings , because when the original value changes, the imported one changes accordingly. js // myModule.js export let x = 1; export const setX = (val) => { x = val; }; js // closureCreator.js import { x } from \"./myModule.js\"; export const getX = () => x; // Close over an imported live binding js import { getX } from \"./closureCreator.js\"; import { setX } from \"./myModule.js\"; console.log(getX()); // 1 setX(2); console.log(getX()); // 2 Creating closures in loops: A common mistake Prior to the introduction of the let keyword, a common problem with closures occurred when you created them inside a loop. To demonstrate, consider the following example code. html <p id=\"help\">Helpful notes will appear here</p> <p>Email: <input type=\"text\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" /></p> <p>Name: <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" /></p> <p>Age: <input type=\"text\" id=\"age\" name=\"age\" /></p> js function showHelp(help) { document.getElementById(\"help\").textContent = help; } function setupHelp() { var helpText = [ { id: \"email\", help: \"Your email address\" }, { id: \"name\", help: \"Your full name\" }, { id: \"age\", help: \"Your age (you must be over 16)\" }, ]; for (var i = 0; i < helpText.length; i++) { // Culprit is the use of `var` on this line var item = helpText[i]; document.getElementById(item.id).onfocus = function () { showHelp(item.help); }; } } setupHelp(); The helpText array defines three helpful hints, each associated with the ID of an input field in the document. The loop cycles through these definitions, hooking up an onfocus event to each one that shows the associated help method. If you try this code out, you'll see that it doesn't work as expected. No matter what field you focus on, the message about your age will be displayed. The reason for this is that the functions assigned to onfocus form closures; they consist of the function definition and the captured environment from the setupHelp function's scope. Three closures have been created by the loop, but each one shares the same single lexical environment, which has a variable with changing values ( item ). This is because the variable item is declared with var and thus has function scope due to hoisting. The value of item.help is determined when the onfocus callbacks are executed. Because the loop has already run its course by that time, the item variable object (shared by all three closures) has been left pointing to the last entry in the helpText list. One solution in this case is to use more closures: in particular, to use a function factory as described earlier: <p id=\"help\">Helpful notes will appear here</p> <p>Email: <input type=\"text\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\" /></p> <p>Name: <input type=\"text\" id=\"name\" name=\"name\" /></p> <p>Age: <input type=\"text\" id=\"age\" name=\"age\" /></p> js function showHelp(help) { document.getElementById(\"help\").textContent = help; } function makeHelpCallback(help) { return function () { showHelp(help); }; } function setupHelp() { var helpText = [ { id: \"email\", help: \"Your email address\" }, { id: \"name\", help: \"Your full name\" }, { id: \"age\", help: \"Your age (you must be over 16)\" }, ]; for (var i = 0; i < helpText.length; i++) { var item = helpText[i]; document.getElementById(item.id).onfocus = makeHelpCallback(item.help); } } setupHelp(); This works as expected. Rather than the callbacks all sharing a single lexical environment, the makeHelpCallback function creates a new lexical environment for each callback, in which help refers to the corresponding string from the helpText array. One other way to write the above using anonymous closures is: js function showHelp(help) { document.getElementById(\"help\").textContent = help; } function setupHelp() { var helpText = [ { id: \"email\", help: \"Your email address\" }, { id: \"name\", help: \"Your full name\" }, { id: \"age\", help: \"Your age (you must be over 16)\" }, ]; for (var i = 0; i < helpText.length; i++) { (function () { var item = helpText[i]; document.getElementById(item.id).onfocus = function () { showHelp(item.help); }; })(); // Immediate event listener attachment with the current value of item (preserved until iteration). } } setupHelp(); If you don't want to use more closures, you can use the let or const keyword: js function showHelp(help) { document.getElementById(\"help\").textContent = help; } function setupHelp() { const helpText = [ { id: \"email\", help: \"Your email address\" }, { id: \"name\", help: \"Your full name\" }, { id: \"age\", help: \"Your age (you must be over 16)\" }, ]; for (let i = 0; i < helpText.length; i++) { const item = helpText[i]; document.getElementById(item.id).onfocus = () => { showHelp(item.help); }; } } setupHelp(); This example uses const instead of var , so every closure binds the block-scoped variable, meaning that no additional closures are required. If you are writing modern JavaScript anyway, you can consider more alternatives to the plain for loop, such as using for...of loop and declaring item as let or const , or using the forEach() method, which both avoid the closure problem. js for (const item of helpText) { document.getElementById(item.id).onfocus = () => { document.getElementById(\"help\").textContent = item.help; }; } helpText.forEach((item) => { document.getElementById(item.id).onfocus = () => { showHelp(item.help); }; }); Performance considerations As mentioned previously, each function instance manages its own scope and closure. Therefore, it is unwise to unnecessarily create functions within other functions if closures are not needed for a particular task, as it will negatively affect script performance both in terms of processing speed and memory consumption. For instance, when creating a new object/class, methods should normally be associated to the object's prototype rather than defined into the object constructor. The reason is that whenever the constructor is called, the methods would get reassigned (that is, for every object creation). Consider the following case: js function MyObject(name, message) { this.name = name.toString(); this.message = message.toString(); this.getName = function () { return this.name; }; this.getMessage = function () { return this.message; }; } Because the previous code does not take advantage of the benefits of using closures in this particular instance, we could instead rewrite it to avoid using closures as follows: js function MyObject(name, message) { this.name = name.toString(); this.message = message.toString(); } MyObject.prototype = { getName() { return this.name; }, getMessage() { return this.message; }, }; However, redefining the prototype is not recommended. The following example instead appends to the existing prototype: js function MyObject(name, message) { this.name = name.toString(); this.message = message.toString(); } MyObject.prototype.getName = function () { return this.name; }; MyObject.prototype.getMessage = function () { return this.message; }; In the two previous examples, the inherited prototype can be shared by all objects and the method definitions need not occur at every object creation.

      "text_content": "Inheritance and the prototype chain In programming, inheritance refers to passing down characteristics from a parent to a child so that a new piece of code can reuse and build upon the features of an existing one. JavaScript implements inheritance by using objects . Each object has an internal link to another object called its prototype . That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype. By definition, null has no prototype and acts as the final link in this prototype chain . It is possible to mutate any member of the prototype chain or even swap out the prototype at runtime, so concepts like static dispatching do not exist in JavaScript. JavaScript is a bit confusing for developers experienced in class-based languages (like Java or C++), as it is dynamic and does not have static types. While this confusion is often considered to be one of JavaScript's weaknesses, the prototypal inheritance model itself is, in fact, more powerful than the classic model. It is, for example, fairly trivial to build a classic model on top of a prototypal model â which is how classes are implemented. Although classes are now widely adopted and have become a new paradigm in JavaScript, classes do not bring a new inheritance pattern. While classes abstract most of the prototypal mechanism away, understanding how prototypes work under the hood is still useful. Inheritance with the prototype chain Inheriting properties JavaScript objects are dynamic \"bags\" of properties (referred to as own properties ). JavaScript objects have a link to a prototype object. When trying to access a property of an object, the property will not only be sought on the object, but also on the prototype of the object, the prototype of the prototype, and so on, until either a property with a matching name is found or the end of the prototype chain is reached. Note: Following the ECMAScript standard, the notation someObject.[[Prototype]] is used to designate the prototype of someObject . The [[Prototype]] internal slot can be accessed and modified with the Object.getPrototypeOf() and Object.setPrototypeOf() functions respectively. This is equivalent to the JavaScript accessor __proto__ which is non-standard but de-facto implemented by many JavaScript engines. To prevent confusion while keeping it succinct, in our notation we will avoid using obj.__proto__ but use obj.[[Prototype]] instead. This corresponds to Object.getPrototypeOf(obj) . It should not be confused with the func.prototype property of functions, which instead specifies the [[Prototype]] to be assigned to all instances of objects created by the given function when used as a constructor. We will discuss the prototype property of constructor functions in a later section . There are several ways to specify the [[Prototype]] of an object, which are listed in a later section . For now, we will use the __proto__ syntax for illustration. It's worth noting that the { __proto__: ... } syntax is different from the obj.__proto__ accessor: the former is standard and not deprecated. In an object literal like { a: 1, b: 2, __proto__: c } , the value c (which has to be either null or another object) will become the [[Prototype]] of the object represented by the literal, while the other keys like a and b will become the own properties of the object. This syntax reads very naturally, since [[Prototype]] is just an \"internal property\" of the object. Here is what happens when trying to access a property: js const o = { a: 1, b: 2, // __proto__ sets the [[Prototype]]. It's specified here // as another object literal. __proto__: { b: 3, c: 4, }, }; // o.[[Prototype]] has properties b and c. // o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is Object.prototype (we will explain // what that means later). // Finally, o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is null. // This is the end of the prototype chain, as null, // by definition, has no [[Prototype]]. // Thus, the full prototype chain looks like: // { a: 1, b: 2 } ---> { b: 3, c: 4 } ---> Object.prototype ---> null console.log(o.a); // 1 // Is there an 'a' own property on o? Yes, and its value is 1. console.log(o.b); // 2 // Is there a 'b' own property on o? Yes, and its value is 2. // The prototype also has a 'b' property, but it's not visited. // This is called Property Shadowing console.log(o.c); // 4 // Is there a 'c' own property on o? No, check its prototype. // Is there a 'c' own property on o.[[Prototype]]? Yes, its value is 4. console.log(o.d); // undefined // Is there a 'd' own property on o? No, check its prototype. // Is there a 'd' own property on o.[[Prototype]]? No, check its prototype. // o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is Object.prototype and // there is no 'd' property by default, check its prototype. // o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is null, stop searching, // no property found, return undefined. Setting a property to an object creates an own property. The only exception to the getting and setting behavior rules is when it's intercepted by a getter or setter . Similarly, you can create longer prototype chains, and a property will be sought on all of them. js const o = { a: 1, b: 2, // __proto__ sets the [[Prototype]]. It's specified here // as another object literal. __proto__: { b: 3, c: 4, __proto__: { d: 5, }, }, }; // { a: 1, b: 2 } ---> { b: 3, c: 4 } ---> { d: 5 } ---> Object.prototype ---> null console.log(o.d); // 5 Inheriting \"methods\" JavaScript does not have \" methods \" in the form that class-based languages define them. In JavaScript, any function can be added to an object in the form of a property. An inherited function acts just as any other property, including property shadowing as shown above (in this case, a form of method overriding ). When an inherited function is executed, the value of this points to the inheriting object, not to the prototype object where the function is an own property. js const parent = { value: 2, method() { return this.value + 1; }, }; console.log(parent.method()); // 3 // When calling parent.method in this case, 'this' refers to parent // child is an object that inherits from parent const child = { __proto__: parent, }; console.log(child.method()); // 3 // When child.method is called, 'this' refers to child. // So when child inherits the method of parent, // The property 'value' is sought on child. However, since child // doesn't have an own property called 'value', the property is // found on the [[Prototype]], which is parent.value. child.value = 4; // assign the value 4 to the property 'value' on child. // This shadows the 'value' property on parent. // The child object now looks like: // { value: 4, __proto__: { value: 2, method: [Function] } } console.log(child.method()); // 5 // Since child now has the 'value' property, 'this.value' means // child.value instead Constructors The power of prototypes is that we can reuse a set of properties if they should be present on every instance â especially for methods. Suppose we are to create a series of boxes, where each box is an object that contains a value which can be accessed through a getValue function. A naive implementation would be: js const boxes = [ { value: 1, getValue() { return this.value; } }, { value: 2, getValue() { return this.value; } }, { value: 3, getValue() { return this.value; } }, ]; This is subpar, because each instance has its own function property that does the same thing, which is redundant and unnecessary. Instead, we can move getValue to the [[Prototype]] of all boxes: js const boxPrototype = { getValue() { return this.value; }, }; const boxes = [ { value: 1, __proto__: boxPrototype }, { value: 2, __proto__: boxPrototype }, { value: 3, __proto__: boxPrototype }, ]; This way, all boxes' getValue method will refer to the same function, lowering memory usage. However, manually binding the __proto__ for every object creation is still very inconvenient. This is when we would use a constructor function, which automatically sets the [[Prototype]] for every object manufactured. Constructors are functions called with new . js // A constructor function function Box(value) { this.value = value; } // Properties all boxes created from the Box() constructor // will have Box.prototype.getValue = function () { return this.value; }; const boxes = [new Box(1), new Box(2), new Box(3)]; We say that new Box(1) is an instance created from the Box constructor function. Box.prototype is not much different from the boxPrototype object we created previously â it's just a plain object. Every instance created from a constructor function will automatically have the constructor's prototype property as its [[Prototype]] â that is, Object.getPrototypeOf(new Box()) === Box.prototype . Constructor.prototype by default has one own property: constructor , which references the constructor function itself â that is, Box.prototype.constructor === Box . This allows one to access the original constructor from any instance. Note: If a non-primitive is returned from the constructor function, that value will become the result of the new expression. In this case the [[Prototype]] may not be correctly bound â but this should not happen much in practice. The above constructor function can be rewritten in classes as: js class Box { constructor(value) { this.value = value; } // Methods are created on Box.prototype getValue() { return this.value; } } Classes are syntax sugar over constructor functions, which means you can still manipulate Box.prototype to change the behavior of all instances. However, because classes are designed to be an abstraction over the underlying prototype mechanism, we will use the more-lightweight constructor function syntax for this tutorial to fully demonstrate how prototypes work. Because Box.prototype references the same object as the [[Prototype]] of all instances, we can change the behavior of all instances by mutating Box.prototype . js function Box(value) { this.value = value; } Box.prototype.getValue = function () { return this.value; }; const box = new Box(1); // Mutate Box.prototype after an instance has already been created Box.prototype.getValue = function () { return this.value + 1; }; box.getValue(); // 2 A corollary is, re-assigning Constructor.prototype ( Constructor.prototype = ... ) is a bad idea for two reasons: The [[Prototype]] of instances created before the reassignment is now referencing a different object from the [[Prototype]] of instances created after the reassignment â mutating one's [[Prototype]] no longer mutates the other. Unless you manually re-set the constructor property, the constructor function can no longer be traced from instance.constructor , which may break user expectation. Some built-in operations will read the constructor property as well, and if it is not set, they may not work as expected. Constructor.prototype is only useful when constructing instances. It has nothing to do with Constructor.[[Prototype]] , which is the constructor function's own prototype, which is Function.prototype â that is, Object.getPrototypeOf(Constructor) === Function.prototype . Implicit constructors of literals Some literal syntaxes in JavaScript create instances that implicitly set the [[Prototype]] . For example: js // Object literals (without the `__proto__` key) automatically // have `Object.prototype` as their `[[Prototype]]` const object = { a: 1 }; Object.getPrototypeOf(object) === Object.prototype; // true // Array literals automatically have `Array.prototype` as their `[[Prototype]]` const array = [1, 2, 3]; Object.getPrototypeOf(array) === Array.prototype; // true // RegExp literals automatically have `RegExp.prototype` as their `[[Prototype]]` const regexp = /abc/; Object.getPrototypeOf(regexp) === RegExp.prototype; // true We can \"de-sugar\" them into their constructor form. js const array = new Array(1, 2, 3); const regexp = new RegExp(\"abc\"); For example, \"array methods\" like map() are simply methods defined on Array.prototype , which is why they are automatically available on all array instances. Warning: There is one misfeature that used to be prevalent â extending Object.prototype or one of the other built-in prototypes. An example of this misfeature is, defining Array.prototype.myMethod = function () {...} and then using myMethod on all array instances. This misfeature is called monkey patching . Doing monkey patching risks forward compatibility, because if the language adds this method in the future but with a different signature, your code will break. It has led to incidents like the SmooshGate , and can be a great nuisance for the language to advance since JavaScript tries to \"not break the web\". The only good reason for extending a built-in prototype is to backport the features of newer JavaScript engines, like Array.prototype.forEach . It may be interesting to note that due to historical reasons, some built-in constructors' prototype property are instances themselves. For example, Number.prototype is a number 0, Array.prototype is an empty array, and RegExp.prototype is /(?:)/ . js Number.prototype + 1; // 1 Array.prototype.map((x) => x + 1); // [] String.prototype + \"a\"; // \"a\" RegExp.prototype.source; // \"(?:)\" Function.prototype(); // Function.prototype is a no-op function by itself However, this is not the case for user-defined constructors, nor for modern constructors like Map . js Map.prototype.get(1); // Uncaught TypeError: get method called on incompatible Map.prototype Building longer inheritance chains The Constructor.prototype property will become the [[Prototype]] of the constructor's instances, as-is â including Constructor.prototype 's own [[Prototype]] . By default, Constructor.prototype is a plain object â that is, Object.getPrototypeOf(Constructor.prototype) === Object.prototype . The only exception is Object.prototype itself, whose [[Prototype]] is null â that is, Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype) === null . Therefore, a typical constructor will build the following prototype chain: js function Constructor() {} const obj = new Constructor(); // obj ---> Constructor.prototype ---> Object.prototype ---> null To build longer prototype chains, we can set the [[Prototype]] of Constructor.prototype via the Object.setPrototypeOf() function. js function Base() {} function Derived() {} // Set the `[[Prototype]]` of `Derived.prototype` // to `Base.prototype` Object.setPrototypeOf(Derived.prototype, Base.prototype); const obj = new Derived(); // obj ---> Derived.prototype ---> Base.prototype ---> Object.prototype ---> null In class terms, this is equivalent to using the extends syntax. js class Base {} class Derived extends Base {} const obj = new Derived(); // obj ---> Derived.prototype ---> Base.prototype ---> Object.prototype ---> null You may also see some legacy code using Object.create() to build the inheritance chain. However, because this reassigns the prototype property and removes the constructor property, it can be more error-prone, while performance gains may not be apparent if the constructors haven't created any instances yet. js function Base() {} function Derived() {} // Re-assigns `Derived.prototype` to a new object // with `Base.prototype` as its `[[Prototype]]` // DON'T DO THIS â use Object.setPrototypeOf to mutate it instead Derived.prototype = Object.create(Base.prototype); Inspecting prototypes: a deeper dive Let's look at what happens behind the scenes in a bit more detail. In JavaScript, as mentioned above, functions are able to have properties. All functions have a special property named prototype . Please note that the code below is free-standing (it is safe to assume there is no other JavaScript on the webpage other than the below code). For the best learning experience, it is highly recommended that you open a console, navigate to the \"console\" tab, copy-and-paste in the below JavaScript code, and run it by pressing the Enter/Return key. (The console is included in most web browser's Developer Tools. More information is available for Firefox Developer Tools , Chrome DevTools , and Edge DevTools .) js function doSomething() {} console.log(doSomething.prototype); // It does not matter how you declare the function; a // function in JavaScript will always have a default // prototype property â with one exception: an arrow // function doesn't have a default prototype property: const doSomethingFromArrowFunction = () => {}; console.log(doSomethingFromArrowFunction.prototype); As seen above, doSomething() has a default prototype property, as demonstrated by the console. After running this code, the console should have displayed an object that looks similar to this. { constructor: Æ doSomething(), [[Prototype]]: { constructor: Æ Object(), hasOwnProperty: Æ hasOwnProperty(), isPrototypeOf: Æ isPrototypeOf(), propertyIsEnumerable: Æ propertyIsEnumerable(), toLocaleString: Æ toLocaleString(), toString: Æ toString(), valueOf: Æ valueOf() } } Note: The Chrome console uses [[Prototype]] to denote the object's prototype, following the spec's terms; Firefox uses <prototype> . For consistency we will use [[Prototype]] . We can add properties to the prototype of doSomething() , as shown below. js function doSomething() {} doSomething.prototype.foo = \"bar\"; console.log(doSomething.prototype); This results in: { foo: \"bar\", constructor: Æ doSomething(), [[Prototype]]: { constructor: Æ Object(), hasOwnProperty: Æ hasOwnProperty(), isPrototypeOf: Æ isPrototypeOf(), propertyIsEnumerable: Æ propertyIsEnumerable(), toLocaleString: Æ toLocaleString(), toString: Æ toString(), valueOf: Æ valueOf() } } We can now use the new operator to create an instance of doSomething() based on this prototype. To use the new operator, call the function normally except prefix it with new . Calling a function with the new operator returns an object that is an instance of the function. Properties can then be added onto this object. Try the following code: js function doSomething() {} doSomething.prototype.foo = \"bar\"; // add a property onto the prototype const doSomeInstancing = new doSomething(); doSomeInstancing.prop = \"some value\"; // add a property onto the object console.log(doSomeInstancing); This results in an output similar to the following: { prop: \"some value\", [[Prototype]]: { foo: \"bar\", constructor: Æ doSomething(), [[Prototype]]: { constructor: Æ Object(), hasOwnProperty: Æ hasOwnProperty(), isPrototypeOf: Æ isPrototypeOf(), propertyIsEnumerable: Æ propertyIsEnumerable(), toLocaleString: Æ toLocaleString(), toString: Æ toString(), valueOf: Æ valueOf() } } } As seen above, the [[Prototype]] of doSomeInstancing is doSomething.prototype . But, what does this do? When you access a property of doSomeInstancing , the runtime first looks to see if doSomeInstancing has that property. If doSomeInstancing does not have the property, then the runtime looks for the property in doSomeInstancing.[[Prototype]] (a.k.a. doSomething.prototype ). If doSomeInstancing.[[Prototype]] has the property being looked for, then that property on doSomeInstancing.[[Prototype]] is used. Otherwise, if doSomeInstancing.[[Prototype]] does not have the property, then doSomeInstancing.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is checked for the property. By default, the [[Prototype]] of any function's prototype property is Object.prototype . So, doSomeInstancing.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] (a.k.a. doSomething.prototype.[[Prototype]] (a.k.a. Object.prototype )) is then looked through for the property being searched for. If the property is not found in doSomeInstancing.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] , then doSomeInstancing.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is looked through. However, there is a problem: doSomeInstancing.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] does not exist, because Object.prototype.[[Prototype]] is null . Then, and only then, after the entire prototype chain of [[Prototype]] 's is looked through, the runtime asserts that the property does not exist and conclude that the value at the property is undefined . Let's try entering some more code into the console: js function doSomething() {} doSomething.prototype.foo = \"bar\"; const doSomeInstancing = new doSomething(); doSomeInstancing.prop = \"some value\"; console.log(\"doSomeInstancing.prop: \", doSomeInstancing.prop); console.log(\"doSomeInstancing.foo: \", doSomeInstancing.foo); console.log(\"doSomething.prop: \", doSomething.prop); console.log(\"doSomething.foo: \", doSomething.foo); console.log(\"doSomething.prototype.prop:\", doSomething.prototype.prop); console.log(\"doSomething.prototype.foo: \", doSomething.prototype.foo); This results in the following: doSomeInstancing.prop: some value doSomeInstancing.foo: bar doSomething.prop: undefined doSomething.foo: undefined doSomething.prototype.prop: undefined doSomething.prototype.foo: bar Different ways of creating and mutating prototype chains We have encountered many ways to create objects and change their prototype chains. We will systematically summarize the different ways, comparing each approach's pros and cons. Objects created with syntax constructs js const o = { a: 1 }; // The newly created object o has Object.prototype as its [[Prototype]] // Object.prototype has null as its [[Prototype]]. // o ---> Object.prototype ---> null const b = [\"yo\", \"sup\", \"?\"]; // Arrays inherit from Array.prototype // (which has methods indexOf, forEach, etc.) // The prototype chain looks like: // b ---> Array.prototype ---> Object.prototype ---> null function f() { return 2; } // Functions inherit from Function.prototype // (which has methods call, bind, etc.) // f ---> Function.prototype ---> Object.prototype ---> null const p = { b: 2, __proto__: o }; // It is possible to point the newly created object's [[Prototype]] to // another object via the __proto__ literal property. (Not to be confused // with Object.prototype.__proto__ accessors) // p ---> o ---> Object.prototype ---> null When using the __proto__ key in object initializers , pointing the __proto__ key to something that is not an object only fails silently without throwing an exception. Contrary to the Object.prototype.__proto__ setter, __proto__ in object literal initializers is standardized and optimized, and can even be more performant than Object.create . Declaring extra own properties on the object at creation is more ergonomic than Object.create . With constructor functions js function Graph() { this.vertices = []; this.edges = []; } Graph.prototype.addVertex = function (v) { this.vertices.push(v); }; const g = new Graph(); // g is an object with own properties 'vertices' and 'edges'. // g.[[Prototype]] is the value of Graph.prototype when new Graph() is executed. Constructor functions have been available since very early JavaScript. Therefore, it is very fast, very standard, and very JIT-optimizable. However, it's also hard to \"do properly\" because methods added this way are enumerable by default, which is inconsistent with the class syntax or how built-in methods behave. Doing longer inheritance chains is also error-prone, as previously demonstrated. With Object.create() Calling Object.create() creates a new object. The [[Prototype]] of this object is the first argument of the function: js const a = { a: 1 }; // a ---> Object.prototype ---> null const b = Object.create(a); // b ---> a ---> Object.prototype ---> null console.log(b.a); // 1 (inherited) const c = Object.create(b); // c ---> b ---> a ---> Object.prototype ---> null const d = Object.create(null); // d ---> null (d is an object that has null directly as its prototype) console.log(d.hasOwnProperty); // undefined, because d doesn't inherit from Object.prototype Similar to the __proto__ key in object initializers, Object.create() allows directly setting the prototype of an object at creation time, which permits the runtime to further optimize the object. It also allows the creation of objects with null prototype, using Object.create(null) . The second parameter of Object.create() allows you to precisely specify the attributes of each property in the new object, which can be a double-edged sword: It allows you to create non-enumerable properties, etc., during object creation, which is not possible with object literals. It is much more verbose and error-prone than object literals. It may be slower than object literals, especially when creating many properties. With classes js class Rectangle { constructor(height, width) { this.name = \"Rectangle\"; this.height = height; this.width = width; } } class FilledRectangle extends Rectangle { constructor(height, width, color) { super(height, width); this.name = \"Filled rectangle\"; this.color = color; } } const filledRectangle = new FilledRectangle(5, 10, \"blue\"); // filledRectangle ---> FilledRectangle.prototype ---> Rectangle.prototype ---> Object.prototype ---> null Classes offer the highest readability and maintainability when defining complex inheritance structures. Private elements are a feature with no trivial replacement in prototypal inheritance. However, classes are less optimized than traditional constructor functions and are not supported in older environments. With Object.setPrototypeOf() While all methods above will set the prototype chain at object creation time, Object.setPrototypeOf() allows mutating the [[Prototype]] internal property of an existing object. It can even force a prototype on a prototype-less object created with Object.create(null) or remove the prototype of an object by setting it to null . js const obj = { a: 1 }; const anotherObj = { b: 2 }; Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, anotherObj); // obj ---> anotherObj ---> Object.prototype ---> null However, you should set the prototype during creation if possible, because setting the prototype dynamically disrupts all optimizations that engines have made to the prototype chain. It might cause some engines to recompile your code for de-optimization, to make it work according to the specs. With the __proto__ accessor All objects inherit the Object.prototype.__proto__ setter, which can be used to set the [[Prototype]] of an existing object (if the __proto__ key is not overridden on the object). Warning: Object.prototype.__proto__ accessors are non-standard and deprecated. You should almost always use Object.setPrototypeOf instead. js const obj = {}; // DON'T USE THIS: for example only. obj.__proto__ = { barProp: \"bar val\" }; obj.__proto__.__proto__ = { fooProp: \"foo val\" }; console.log(obj.fooProp); console.log(obj.barProp); Compared to Object.setPrototypeOf , setting __proto__ to something that is not an object fails silently without throwing an exception. It also has slightly better browser support. However, it is non-standard and deprecated. You should almost always use Object.setPrototypeOf instead. Performance The lookup time for properties that are high up on the prototype chain can have a negative impact on the performance, and this may be significant in the code where performance is critical. Additionally, trying to access nonexistent properties will always traverse the full prototype chain. Also, when iterating over the properties of an object, every enumerable property that is on the prototype chain will be enumerated. To check whether an object has a property defined on itself and not somewhere on its prototype chain, it is necessary to use the hasOwnProperty or Object.hasOwn methods. All objects, except those with null as [[Prototype]] , inherit hasOwnProperty from Object.prototype â unless it has been overridden further down the prototype chain. To give you a concrete example, let's take the above graph example code to illustrate it: js function Graph() { this.vertices = []; this.edges = []; } Graph.prototype.addVertex = function (v) { this.vertices.push(v); }; const g = new Graph(); // g ---> Graph.prototype ---> Object.prototype ---> null g.hasOwnProperty(\"vertices\"); // true Object.hasOwn(g, \"vertices\"); // true g.hasOwnProperty(\"nope\"); // false Object.hasOwn(g, \"nope\"); // false g.hasOwnProperty(\"addVertex\"); // false Object.hasOwn(g, \"addVertex\"); // false Object.getPrototypeOf(g).hasOwnProperty(\"addVertex\"); // true Note: It is not enough to check whether a property is undefined . The property might very well exist, but its value just happens to be set to undefined . Conclusion JavaScript may be a bit confusing for developers coming from Java or C++, as it's all dynamic, all runtime, and it has no static types at all. Everything is either an object (instance) or a function (constructor), and even functions themselves are instances of the Function constructor. Even the \"classes\" as syntax constructs are just constructor functions at runtime. All constructor functions in JavaScript have a special property called prototype , which works with the new operator. The reference to the prototype object is copied to the internal [[Prototype]] property of the new instance. For example, when you do const a1 = new A() , JavaScript (after creating the object in memory and before running function A() with this defined to it) sets a1.[[Prototype]] = A.prototype . When you then access properties of the instance, JavaScript first checks whether they exist on that object directly, and if not, it looks in [[Prototype]] . [[Prototype]] is looked at recursively , i.e., a1.doSomething , Object.getPrototypeOf(a1).doSomething , Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(a1)).doSomething etc., until it's found or Object.getPrototypeOf returns null . This means that all properties defined on prototype are effectively shared by all instances, and you can even later change parts of prototype and have the changes appear in all existing instances. If, in the example above, you do const a1 = new A(); const a2 = new A(); , then a1.doSomething would actually refer to Object.getPrototypeOf(a1).doSomething â which is the same as the A.prototype.doSomething you defined, i.e., Object.getPrototypeOf(a1).doSomething === Object.getPrototypeOf(a2).doSomething === A.prototype.doSomething . It is essential to understand the prototypal inheritance model before writing complex code that makes use of it. Also, be aware of the length of the prototype chains in your code and break them up if necessary to avoid possible performance problems. Further, the native prototypes should never be extended unless it is for the sake of compatibility with newer JavaScript features.

In contrast, JavaScript automatically allocates memory when objects are created and frees it when they are not used anymore ( garbage collection ). This automaticity is a potential source of confusion: it can give developers the false impression that they don't need to worry about memory management. Memory life cycle Regardless of the programming language, the memory life cycle is pretty much always the same: Allocate the memory you need Use the allocated memory (read, write) Release the allocated memory when it is not needed anymore The second part is explicit in all languages. The first and last parts are explicit in low-level languages but are mostly implicit in high-level languages like JavaScript. Allocation in JavaScript Value initialization In order to not bother the programmer with allocations, JavaScript will automatically allocate memory when values are initially declared. js const n = 123; // allocates memory for a number const s = \"string\"; // allocates memory for a string const o = { a: 1, b: null, }; // allocates memory for an object and contained values // (like object) allocates memory for the array and // contained values const a = [1, null, \"str2\"]; function f(a) { return a + 2; } // allocates a function (which is a callable object) // function expressions also allocate an object someElement.addEventListener(\"click\", () => { someElement.style.backgroundColor = \"blue\"; }); Allocation via function calls Some function calls result in object allocation. js const d = new Date(); // allocates a Date object const e = document.createElement(\"div\"); // allocates a DOM element Some methods allocate new values or objects: js const s = \"string\"; const s2 = s.substring(0, 3); // s2 is a new string // Since strings are immutable values, // JavaScript may decide to not allocate memory, // but just store the [0, 3] range. const a = [\"yeah yeah\", \"no no\"]; const a2 = [\"generation\", \"no no\"]; const a3 = a.concat(a2); // new array with 4 elements being // the concatenation of a and a2 elements. Using values Using values basically means reading and writing in allocated memory. This can be done by reading or writing the value of a variable or an object property or even passing an argument to a function. Release when the memory is not needed anymore The majority of memory management issues occur at this phase. The most difficult aspect of this stage is determining when the allocated memory is no longer needed. Low-level languages require the developer to manually determine at which point in the program the allocated memory is no longer needed and to release it. Some high-level languages, such as JavaScript, utilize a form of automatic memory management known as garbage collection (GC). The purpose of a garbage collector is to monitor memory allocation and determine when a block of allocated memory is no longer needed and reclaim it. This automatic process is an approximation since the general problem of determining whether or not a specific piece of memory is still needed is undecidable . Garbage collection As stated above, the general problem of automatically finding whether some memory \"is not needed anymore\" is undecidable. As a consequence, garbage collectors implement a restriction of a solution to the general problem. This section will explain the concepts that are necessary for understanding the main garbage collection algorithms and their respective limitations. References The main concept that garbage collection algorithms rely on is the concept of reference . Within the context of memory management, an object is said to reference another object if the former has access to the latter (either implicitly or explicitly). For instance, a JavaScript object has a reference to its prototype (implicit reference) and to its properties values (explicit reference). In this context, the notion of an \"object\" is extended to something broader than regular JavaScript objects and also contain function scopes (or the global lexical scope). Reference-counting garbage collection Note: No modern JavaScript engine uses reference-counting for garbage collection anymore. This is the most naÃ¯ve garbage collection algorithm. This algorithm reduces the problem from determining whether or not an object is still needed to determining if an object still has any other objects referencing it. An object is said to be \"garbage\", or collectible if there are zero references pointing to it. For example: js let x = { a: { b: 2, }, }; // 2 objects are created. One is referenced by the other as one of its properties. // The other is referenced by virtue of being assigned to the 'x' variable. // Obviously, none can be garbage-collected. let y = x; // The 'y' variable is the second thing that has a reference to the object. x = 1; // Now, the object that was originally in 'x' has a unique reference // embodied by the 'y' variable. let z = y.a; // Reference to 'a' property of the object. // This object now has 2 references: one as a property, // the other as the 'z' variable. y = \"mozilla\"; // The object that was originally in 'x' has now zero // references to it. It can be garbage-collected. // However its 'a' property is still referenced by // the 'z' variable, so it cannot be freed. z = null; // The 'a' property of the object originally in x // has zero references to it. It can be garbage collected. There is a limitation when it comes to circular references. In the following example, two objects are created with properties that reference one another, thus creating a cycle. They will go out of scope after the function call has completed. At that point they become unneeded and their allocated memory should be reclaimed. However, the reference-counting algorithm will not consider them reclaimable since each of the two objects has at least one reference pointing to them, resulting in neither of them being marked for garbage collection. Circular references are a common cause of memory leaks. js function f() { const x = {}; const y = {}; x.a = y; // x references y y.a = x; // y references x return \"azerty\"; } f(); Mark-and-sweep algorithm This algorithm reduces the definition of \"an object is no longer needed\" to \"an object is unreachable\". This algorithm assumes the knowledge of a set of objects called roots. In JavaScript, the root is the global object. Periodically, the garbage collector will start from these roots, find all objects that are referenced from these roots, then all objects referenced from these, etc. Starting from the roots, the garbage collector will thus find all reachable objects and collect all non-reachable objects. This algorithm is an improvement over the previous one since an object having zero references is effectively unreachable. The opposite does not hold true as we have seen with circular references. Currently, all modern engines ship a mark-and-sweep garbage collector. All improvements made in the field of JavaScript garbage collection (generational/incremental/concurrent/parallel garbage collection) over the last few years are implementation improvements of this algorithm, but not improvements over the garbage collection algorithm itself nor its reduction of the definition of when \"an object is no longer needed\". The immediate benefit of this approach is that cycles are no longer a problem. In the first example above, after the function call returns, the two objects are no longer referenced by any resource that is reachable from the global object. Consequently, they will be found unreachable by the garbage collector and have their allocated memory reclaimed. However, the inability to manually control garbage collection remains. There are times when it would be convenient to manually decide when and what memory is released. In order to release the memory of an object, it needs to be made explicitly unreachable. It is also not possible to programmatically trigger garbage collection in JavaScript â and will likely never be within the core language, although engines may expose APIs behind opt-in flags. Configuring an engine's memory model JavaScript engines typically offer flags that expose the memory model. For example, Node.js offers additional options and tools that expose the underlying V8 mechanisms for configuring and debugging memory issues. This configuration may not be available in browsers, and even less so for web pages (via HTTP headers, etc.). The max amount of available heap memory can be increased with a flag: bash node --max-old-space-size=6000 index.js We can also expose the garbage collector for debugging memory issues using a flag and the Chrome Debugger : bash node --expose-gc --inspect index.js Data structures aiding memory management Although JavaScript does not directly expose the garbage collector API, the language offers several data structures that indirectly observe garbage collection and can be used to manage memory usage. WeakMaps and WeakSets WeakMap and WeakSet are data structures whose APIs closely mirror their non-weak counterparts: Map and Set . WeakMap allows you to maintain a collection of key-value pairs, while WeakSet allows you to maintain a collection of unique values, both with performant addition, deletion, and querying. WeakMap and WeakSet got the name from the concept of weakly held values. If x is weakly held by y , it means that although you can access the value of x via y , the mark-and-sweep algorithm won't consider x as reachable if nothing else strongly holds to it. Most data structures, except the ones discussed here, strongly holds to the objects passed in so that you can retrieve them at any time. The keys of WeakMap and WeakSet can be garbage-collected (for WeakMap objects, the values would then be eligible for garbage collection as well) as long as nothing else in the program is referencing the key. This is ensured by two characteristics: WeakMap and WeakSet can only store objects or symbols. This is because only objects are garbage collected â primitive values can always be forged (that is, 1 === 1 but {} !== {} ), making them stay in the collection forever. Registered symbols (like Symbol.for(\"key\") ) can also be forged and thus not garbage collectable, but symbols created with Symbol(\"key\") are garbage collectable. Well-known symbols like Symbol.iterator come in a fixed set and are unique throughout the lifetime of the program, similar to intrinsic objects such as Array.prototype , so they are also allowed as keys. WeakMap and WeakSet are not iterable. This prevents you from using Array.from(map.keys()).length to observe the liveliness of objects, or get hold of an arbitrary key which should otherwise be eligible for garbage collection. (Garbage collection should be as invisible as possible.) In typical explanations of WeakMap and WeakSet (such as the one above), it's often implied that the key is garbage-collected first, freeing the value for garbage collection as well. However, consider the case of the value referencing the key: js const wm = new WeakMap(); const key = {}; wm.set(key, { key }); // Now `key` cannot be garbage collected, // because the value holds a reference to the key, // and the value is strongly held in the map! If key is stored as an actual reference, it would create a cyclic reference and make both the key and value ineligible for garbage collection, even when nothing else references key â because if key is garbage collected, it means that at some particular instant, value.key would point to a non-existent address, which is not legal. To fix this, the entries of WeakMap and WeakSet aren't actual references, but ephemerons , an enhancement to the mark-and-sweep mechanism. Barros et al. offers a good summary of the algorithm (page 4). To quote a paragraph: Ephemerons are a refinement of weak pairs where neither the key nor the value can be classified as weak or strong. The connectivity of the key determines the connectivity of the value, but the connectivity of the value does not affect the connectivity of the key. [â¦] when the garbage collection offers support to ephemerons, it occurs in three phases instead of two (mark and sweep). As a rough mental model, think of a WeakMap as the following implementation: Warning: This is not a polyfill, nor is it anywhere close to how it's implemented in the engine (which hooks into the garbage collection mechanism). js class MyWeakMap { #marker = Symbol(\"MyWeakMapData\"); get(key) { return key[this.#marker]; } set(key, value) { key[this.#marker] = value; } has(key) { return this.#marker in key; } delete(key) { delete key[this.#marker]; } } As you can see, the MyWeakMap never actually holds a collection of keys. It simply adds metadata to each object being passed in. The object is then garbage-collectable via mark-and-sweep. Therefore, it's not possible to iterate over the keys in a WeakMap , nor clear the WeakMap (as that also relies on the knowledge of the entire key collection). For more information on their APIs, see the keyed collections guide. WeakRefs and FinalizationRegistry Note: WeakRef and FinalizationRegistry offer direct introspection into the garbage collection machinery. Avoid using them where possible because the runtime semantics are almost completely unguaranteed. All variables with an object as value are references to that object. However, such references are strong â their existence would prevent the garbage collector from marking the object as eligible for collection. A WeakRef is a weak reference to an object that allows the object to be garbage collected, while still retaining the ability to read the object's content during its lifetime. One use case for WeakRef is a cache system which maps string URLs to large objects. We cannot use a WeakMap for this purpose, because WeakMap objects have their keys weakly held, but not their values â if you access a key, you would always deterministically get the value (since having access to the key means it's still alive). Here, we are okay to get undefined for a key (if the corresponding value is no longer alive) since we can just re-compute it, but we don't want unreachable objects to stay in the cache. In this case, we can use a normal Map , but with each value being a WeakRef of the object instead of the actual object value. js function cached(getter) { // A Map from string URLs to WeakRefs of results const cache = new Map(); return async (key) => { if (cache.has(key)) { const dereferencedValue = cache.get(key).deref(); if (dereferencedValue !== undefined) { return dereferencedValue; } } const value = await getter(key); cache.set(key, new WeakRef(value)); return value; }; } const getImage = cached((url) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.blob())); FinalizationRegistry provides an even stronger mechanism to observe garbage collection. It allows you to register objects and be notified when they are garbage collected. For example, for the cache system exemplified above, even when the blobs themselves are free for collection, the WeakRef objects that hold them are not â and over time, the Map may accumulate a lot of useless entries. Using a FinalizationRegistry allows one to perform cleanup in this case. js function cached(getter) { // A Map from string URLs to WeakRefs of results const cache = new Map(); // Every time after a value is garbage collected, the callback is // called with the key in the cache as argument, allowing us to remove // the cache entry const registry = new FinalizationRegistry((key) => { // Note: it's important to test that the WeakRef is indeed empty. // Otherwise, the callback may be called after a new object has been // added with this key, and that new, alive object gets deleted if (!cache.get(key)?.deref()) { cache.delete(key); } }); return async (key) => { if (cache.has(key)) { return cache.get(key).deref(); } const value = await getter(key); cache.set(key, new WeakRef(value)); registry.register(value, key); return value; }; } const getImage = cached((url) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.blob())); Due to performance and security concerns, there is no guarantee of when the callback will be called, or if it will be called at all. It should only be used for cleanup â and non-critical cleanup. There are other ways for more deterministic resource management, such as try...finally , which will always execute the finally block. WeakRef and FinalizationRegistry exist solely for optimization of memory usage in long-running programs. For more information on the API of WeakRef and FinalizationRegistry , see their reference pages.

Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name , and has members for performing common array operations . Description In JavaScript, arrays aren't primitives but are instead Array objects with the following core characteristics: JavaScript arrays are resizable and can contain a mix of different data types . (When those characteristics are undesirable, use typed arrays instead.) JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays and so, array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes, but must be accessed using nonnegative integers (or their respective string form) as indexes. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed : the first element of an array is at index 0 , the second is at index 1 , and so on â and the last element is at the value of the array's length property minus 1 . JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies . (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies ). Array indices Array objects cannot use arbitrary strings as element indexes (as in an associative array ) but must use nonnegative integers (or their respective string form). Setting or accessing via non-integers will not set or retrieve an element from the array list itself, but will set or access a variable associated with that array's object property collection . The array's object properties and list of array elements are separate, and the array's traversal and mutation operations cannot be applied to these named properties. Array elements are object properties in the same way that toString is a property (to be specific, however, toString() is a method). Nevertheless, trying to access an element of an array as follows throws a syntax error because the property name is not valid: js arr.0; // a syntax error JavaScript syntax requires properties beginning with a digit to be accessed using bracket notation instead of dot notation . It's also possible to quote the array indices (e.g., years['2'] instead of years[2] ), although usually not necessary. The 2 in years[2] is coerced into a string by the JavaScript engine through an implicit toString conversion. As a result, '2' and '02' would refer to two different slots on the years object, and the following example could be true : js console.log(years[\"2\"] !== years[\"02\"]); Only years['2'] is an actual array index. years['02'] is an arbitrary string property that will not be visited in array iteration. Relationship between length and numerical properties A JavaScript array's length property and numerical properties are connected. Several of the built-in array methods (e.g., join() , slice() , indexOf() , etc.) take into account the value of an array's length property when they're called. Other methods (e.g., push() , splice() , etc.) also result in updates to an array's length property. js const fruits = []; fruits.push(\"banana\", \"apple\", \"peach\"); console.log(fruits.length); // 3 When setting a property on a JavaScript array when the property is a valid array index and that index is outside the current bounds of the array, the engine will update the array's length property accordingly: js fruits[5] = \"mango\"; console.log(fruits[5]); // 'mango' console.log(Object.keys(fruits)); // ['0', '1', '2', '5'] console.log(fruits.length); // 6 Increasing the length extends the array by adding empty slots without creating any new elements â not even undefined . js fruits.length = 10; console.log(fruits); // ['banana', 'apple', 'peach', empty x 2, 'mango', empty x 4] console.log(Object.keys(fruits)); // ['0', '1', '2', '5'] console.log(fruits.length); // 10 console.log(fruits[8]); // undefined Decreasing the length property does, however, delete elements. js fruits.length = 2; console.log(Object.keys(fruits)); // ['0', '1'] console.log(fruits.length); // 2 This is explained further on the length page. Array methods and empty slots Array methods have different behaviors when encountering empty slots in sparse arrays . In general, older methods (e.g., forEach ) treat empty slots differently from indices that contain undefined . Methods that have special treatment for empty slots include the following: concat() , copyWithin() , every() , filter() , flat() , flatMap() , forEach() , indexOf() , lastIndexOf() , map() , reduce() , reduceRight() , reverse() , slice() , some() , sort() , and splice() . Iteration methods such as forEach don't visit empty slots at all. Other methods, such as concat , copyWithin , etc., preserve empty slots when doing the copying, so in the end the array is still sparse. js const colors = [\"red\", \"yellow\", \"blue\"]; colors[5] = \"purple\"; colors.forEach((item, index) => { console.log(`${index}: ${item}`); }); // Output: // 0: red // 1: yellow // 2: blue // 5: purple colors.reverse(); // ['purple', empty Ã 2, 'blue', 'yellow', 'red'] Newer methods (e.g., keys ) do not treat empty slots specially and treat them as if they contain undefined . Methods that conflate empty slots with undefined elements include the following: entries() , fill() , find() , findIndex() , findLast() , findLastIndex() , includes() , join() , keys() , toLocaleString() , toReversed() , toSorted() , toSpliced() , values() , and with() . js const colors = [\"red\", \"yellow\", \"blue\"]; colors[5] = \"purple\"; const iterator = colors.keys(); for (const key of iterator) { console.log(`${key}: ${colors[key]}`); } // Output // 0: red // 1: yellow // 2: blue // 3: undefined // 4: undefined // 5: purple const newColors = colors.toReversed(); // ['purple', undefined, undefined, 'blue', 'yellow', 'red'] Copying methods and mutating methods Some methods do not mutate the existing array that the method was called on, but instead return a new array. They do so by first constructing a new array and then populating it with elements. The copy always happens shallowly â the method never copies anything beyond the initially created array. Elements of the original array(s) are copied into the new array as follows: Objects: the object reference is copied into the new array. Both the original and new array refer to the same object. That is, if a referenced object is modified, the changes are visible to both the new and original arrays. Primitive types such as strings, numbers and booleans (not String , Number , and Boolean objects): their values are copied into the new array. Other methods mutate the array that the method was called on, in which case their return value differs depending on the method: sometimes a reference to the same array, sometimes the length of the new array. The following methods create new arrays by accessing this.constructor[Symbol.species] to determine the constructor to use: concat() , filter() , flat() , flatMap() , map() , slice() , and splice() (to construct the array of removed elements that's returned). The following methods always create new arrays with the Array base constructor: toReversed() , toSorted() , toSpliced() , and with() . The following table lists the methods that mutate the original array, and the corresponding non-mutating alternative: Mutating method Non-mutating alternative copyWithin() No one-method alternative fill() No one-method alternative pop() slice(0, -1) push(v1, v2) concat([v1, v2]) reverse() toReversed() shift() slice(1) sort() toSorted() splice() toSpliced() unshift(v1, v2) toSpliced(0, 0, v1, v2) An easy way to change a mutating method into a non-mutating alternative is to use the spread syntax or slice() to create a copy first: js arr.copyWithin(0, 1, 2); // mutates arr const arr2 = arr.slice().copyWithin(0, 1, 2); // does not mutate arr const arr3 = [...arr].copyWithin(0, 1, 2); // does not mutate arr Iterative methods Many array methods take a callback function as an argument. The callback function is called sequentially and at most once for each element in the array, and the return value of the callback function is used to determine the return value of the method. They all share the same signature: js method(callbackFn, thisArg) Where callbackFn takes three arguments: element The current element being processed in the array. index The index of the current element being processed in the array. array The array that the method was called upon. What callbackFn is expected to return depends on the array method that was called. The thisArg argument (defaults to undefined ) will be used as the this value when calling callbackFn . The this value ultimately observable by callbackFn is determined according to the usual rules : if callbackFn is non-strict , primitive this values are wrapped into objects, and undefined / null is substituted with globalThis . The thisArg argument is irrelevant for any callbackFn defined with an arrow function , as arrow functions don't have their own this binding . The array argument passed to callbackFn is most useful if you want to read another index during iteration, because you may not always have an existing variable that refers to the current array. You should generally not mutate the array during iteration (see mutating initial array in iterative methods ), but you can also use this argument to do so. The array argument is not the array that is being built, in the case of methods like map() , filter() , and flatMap() â there is no way to access the array being built from the callback function. All iterative methods are copying and generic , although they behave differently with empty slots . The following methods are iterative: every() , filter() , find() , findIndex() , findLast() , findLastIndex() , flatMap() , forEach() , map() , and some() . In particular, every() , find() , findIndex() , findLast() , findLastIndex() , and some() do not always invoke callbackFn on every element â they stop iteration as soon as the return value is determined. The reduce() and reduceRight() methods also take a callback function and run it at most once for each element in the array, but they have slightly different signatures from typical iterative methods (for example, they don't accept thisArg ). The sort() method also takes a callback function, but it is not an iterative method. It mutates the array in-place, doesn't accept thisArg , and may invoke the callback multiple times on an index. Iterative methods iterate the array like the following (with a lot of technical details omitted): js function method(callbackFn, thisArg) { const length = this.length; for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) { if (i in this) { const result = callbackFn.call(thisArg, this[i], i, this); // Do something with result; maybe return early } } } Note the following: Not all methods do the i in this test. The find , findIndex , findLast , and findLastIndex methods do not, but other methods do. The length is memorized before the loop starts. This affects how insertions and deletions during iteration are handled (see mutating initial array in iterative methods ). The method doesn't memorize the array contents, so if any index is modified during iteration, the new value might be observed. The code above iterates the array in ascending order of index. Some methods iterate in descending order of index ( for (let i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) ): reduceRight() , findLast() , and findLastIndex() . reduce and reduceRight have slightly different signatures and do not always start at the first/last element. Generic array methods Array methods are always generic â they don't access any internal data of the array object. They only access the array elements through the length property and the indexed elements. This means that they can be called on array-like objects as well. js const arrayLike = { 0: \"a\", 1: \"b\", length: 2, }; console.log(Array.prototype.join.call(arrayLike, \"+\")); // 'a+b' Normalization of the length property The length property is converted to an integer and then clamped to the range between 0 and 2 53 - 1. NaN becomes 0 , so even when length is not present or is undefined , it behaves as if it has value 0 . The language avoids setting length to an unsafe integer . All built-in methods will throw a TypeError if length will be set to a number greater than 2 53 - 1. However, because the length property of arrays throws an error if it's set to greater than 2 32 - 1, the safe integer threshold is usually not reached unless the method is called on a non-array object. js Array.prototype.flat.call({}); // [] Some array methods set the length property of the array object. They always set the value after normalization, so length always ends as an integer. js const a = { length: 0.7 }; Array.prototype.push.call(a); console.log(a.length); // 0 Array-like objects The term array-like object refers to any object that doesn't throw during the length conversion process described above. In practice, such object is expected to actually have a length property and to have indexed elements in the range 0 to length - 1 . (If it doesn't have all indices, it will be functionally equivalent to a sparse array .) Any integer index less than zero or greater than length - 1 is ignored when an array method operates on an array-like object. Many DOM objects are array-like â for example, NodeList and HTMLCollection . The arguments object is also array-like. You can call array methods on them even if they don't have these methods themselves. js function f() { console.log(Array.prototype.join.call(arguments, \"+\")); } f(\"a\", \"b\"); // 'a+b' Constructor Array() Creates a new Array object.

Note: If you're not yet familiar with array basics, consider first reading JavaScript First Steps: Arrays , which explains what arrays are , and includes other examples of common array operations. Create an array This example shows three ways to create new array: first using array literal notation , then using the Array() constructor, and finally using String.prototype.split() to build the array from a string. js // 'fruits' array created using array literal notation. const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"]; console.log(fruits.length); // 2 // 'fruits2' array created using the Array() constructor. const fruits2 = new Array(\"Apple\", \"Banana\"); console.log(fruits2.length); // 2 // 'fruits3' array created using String.prototype.split(). const fruits3 = \"Apple, Banana\".split(\", \"); console.log(fruits3.length); // 2 Create a string from an array This example uses the join() method to create a string from the fruits array. js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"]; const fruitsString = fruits.join(\", \"); console.log(fruitsString); // \"Apple, Banana\" Access an array item by its index This example shows how to access items in the fruits array by specifying the index number of their position in the array. js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"]; // The index of an array's first element is always 0. fruits[0]; // Apple // The index of an array's second element is always 1. fruits[1]; // Banana // The index of an array's last element is always one // less than the length of the array. fruits[fruits.length - 1]; // Banana // Using an index number larger than the array's length // returns 'undefined'. fruits[99]; // undefined Find the index of an item in an array This example uses the indexOf() method to find the position (index) of the string \"Banana\" in the fruits array. js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"]; console.log(fruits.indexOf(\"Banana\")); // 1 Check if an array contains a certain item This example shows two ways to check if the fruits array contains \"Banana\" and \"Cherry\" : first with the includes() method, and then with the indexOf() method to test for an index value that's not -1 . js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"]; fruits.includes(\"Banana\"); // true fruits.includes(\"Cherry\"); // false // If indexOf() doesn't return -1, the array contains the given item. fruits.indexOf(\"Banana\") !== -1; // true fruits.indexOf(\"Cherry\") !== -1; // false Append an item to an array This example uses the push() method to append a new string to the fruits array. js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"]; const newLength = fruits.push(\"Orange\"); console.log(fruits); // [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Orange\"] console.log(newLength); // 3 Remove the last item from an array This example uses the pop() method to remove the last item from the fruits array. js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Orange\"]; const removedItem = fruits.pop(); console.log(fruits); // [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"] console.log(removedItem); // Orange Note: pop() can only be used to remove the last item from an array. To remove multiple items from the end of an array, see the next example. Remove multiple items from the end of an array This example uses the splice() method to remove the last 3 items from the fruits array. js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Strawberry\", \"Mango\", \"Cherry\"]; const start = -3; const removedItems = fruits.splice(start); console.log(fruits); // [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"] console.log(removedItems); // [\"Strawberry\", \"Mango\", \"Cherry\"] Truncate an array down to just its first N items This example uses the splice() method to truncate the fruits array down to just its first 2 items. js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Strawberry\", \"Mango\", \"Cherry\"]; const start = 2; const removedItems = fruits.splice(start); console.log(fruits); // [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"] console.log(removedItems); // [\"Strawberry\", \"Mango\", \"Cherry\"] Remove the first item from an array This example uses the shift() method to remove the first item from the fruits array. js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\"]; const removedItem = fruits.shift(); console.log(fruits); // [\"Banana\"] console.log(removedItem); // Apple Note: shift() can only be used to remove the first item from an array. To remove multiple items from the beginning of an array, see the next example. Remove multiple items from the beginning of an array This example uses the splice() method to remove the first 3 items from the fruits array. js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Strawberry\", \"Cherry\", \"Banana\", \"Mango\"]; const start = 0; const deleteCount = 3; const removedItems = fruits.splice(start, deleteCount); console.log(fruits); // [\"Banana\", \"Mango\"] console.log(removedItems); // [\"Apple\", \"Strawberry\", \"Cherry\"] Add a new first item to an array This example uses the unshift() method to add, at index 0 , a new item to the fruits array â making it the new first item in the array. js const fruits = [\"Banana\", \"Mango\"]; const newLength = fruits.unshift(\"Strawberry\"); console.log(fruits); // [\"Strawberry\", \"Banana\", \"Mango\"] console.log(newLength); // 3 Remove a single item by index This example uses the splice() method to remove the string \"Banana\" from the fruits array â by specifying the index position of \"Banana\" . js const fruits = [\"Strawberry\", \"Banana\", \"Mango\"]; const start = fruits.indexOf(\"Banana\"); const deleteCount = 1; const removedItems = fruits.splice(start, deleteCount); console.log(fruits); // [\"Strawberry\", \"Mango\"] console.log(removedItems); // [\"Banana\"] Remove multiple items by index This example uses the splice() method to remove the strings \"Banana\" and \"Strawberry\" from the fruits array â by specifying the index position of \"Banana\" , along with a count of the number of total items to remove. js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Strawberry\", \"Mango\"]; const start = 1; const deleteCount = 2; const removedItems = fruits.splice(start, deleteCount); console.log(fruits); // [\"Apple\", \"Mango\"] console.log(removedItems); // [\"Banana\", \"Strawberry\"] Replace multiple items in an array This example uses the splice() method to replace the last 2 items in the fruits array with new items. js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Strawberry\"]; const start = -2; const deleteCount = 2; const removedItems = fruits.splice(start, deleteCount, \"Mango\", \"Cherry\"); console.log(fruits); // [\"Apple\", \"Mango\", \"Cherry\"] console.log(removedItems); // [\"Banana\", \"Strawberry\"] Iterate over an array This example uses a for...of loop to iterate over the fruits array, logging each item to the console. js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Mango\", \"Cherry\"]; for (const fruit of fruits) { console.log(fruit); } // Apple // Mango // Cherry But for...of is just one of many ways to iterate over any array; for more ways, see Loops and iteration , and see the documentation for the every() , filter() , flatMap() , map() , reduce() , and reduceRight() methods â and see the next example, which uses the forEach() method. Call a function on each element in an array This example uses the forEach() method to call a function on each element in the fruits array; the function causes each item to be logged to the console, along with the item's index number. js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Mango\", \"Cherry\"]; fruits.forEach((item, index, array) => { console.log(item, index); }); // Apple 0 // Mango 1 // Cherry 2 Merge multiple arrays together This example uses the concat() method to merge the fruits array with a moreFruits array, to produce a new combinedFruits array. Notice that fruits and moreFruits remain unchanged. js const fruits = [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Strawberry\"]; const moreFruits = [\"Mango\", \"Cherry\"]; const combinedFruits = fruits.concat(moreFruits); console.log(combinedFruits); // [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Strawberry\", \"Mango\", \"Cherry\"] // The 'fruits' array remains unchanged. console.log(fruits); // [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Strawberry\"] // The 'moreFruits' array also remains unchanged. console.log(moreFruits); // [\"Mango\", \"Cherry\"] Copy an array This example shows three ways to create a new array from the existing fruits array: first by using spread syntax , then by using the from() method, and then by using the slice() method. js const fruits = [\"Strawberry\", \"Mango\"]; // Create a copy using spread syntax. const fruitsCopy = [...fruits]; // [\"Strawberry\", \"Mango\"] // Create a copy using the from() method. const fruitsCopy2 = Array.from(fruits); // [\"Strawberry\", \"Mango\"] // Create a copy using the slice() method. const fruitsCopy3 = fruits.slice(); // [\"Strawberry\", \"Mango\"] All built-in array-copy operations ( spread syntax , Array.from() , Array.prototype.slice() , and Array.prototype.concat() ) create shallow copies . If you instead want a deep copy of an array, you can use JSON.stringify() to convert the array to a JSON string, and then JSON.parse() to convert the string back into a new array that's completely independent from the original array. js const fruitsDeepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(fruits)); You can also create deep copies using the structuredClone() method, which has the advantage of allowing transferable objects in the source to be transferred to the new copy, rather than just cloned. Finally, it's important to understand that assigning an existing array to a new variable doesn't create a copy of either the array or its elements. Instead the new variable is just a reference, or alias, to the original array; that is, the original array's name and the new variable name are just two names for the exact same object (and so will always evaluate as strictly equivalent ). Therefore, if you make any changes at all either to the value of the original array or to the value of the new variable, the other will change, too: js const fruits = [\"Strawberry\", \"Mango\"]; const fruitsAlias = fruits; // 'fruits' and 'fruitsAlias' are the same object, strictly equivalent. fruits === fruitsAlias; // true // Any changes to the 'fruits' array change 'fruitsAlias' too. fruits.unshift(\"Apple\", \"Banana\"); console.log(fruits); // ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Strawberry', 'Mango'] console.log(fruitsAlias); // ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Strawberry', 'Mango'] Creating a two-dimensional array The following creates a chessboard as a two-dimensional array of strings. The first move is made by copying the 'p' in board[6][4] to board[4][4] . The old position at [6][4] is made blank. js const board = [ [\"R\", \"N\", \"B\", \"Q\", \"K\", \"B\", \"N\", \"R\"], [\"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\", \"P\"], [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"], [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"], [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"], [\" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"], [\"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\", \"p\"], [\"r\", \"n\", \"b\", \"q\", \"k\", \"b\", \"n\", \"r\"], ]; console.log(`${board.join(\"\\n\")}\\n\\n`); // Move King's Pawn forward 2 board[4][4] = board[6][4]; board[6][4] = \" \"; console.log(board.join(\"\\n\")); Here is the output: R,N,B,Q,K,B,N,R P,P,P,P,P,P,P,P , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p r,n,b,q,k,b,n,r R,N,B,Q,K,B,N,R P,P,P,P,P,P,P,P , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,p, , , , , , , , , , p,p,p,p, ,p,p,p r,n,b,q,k,b,n,r Using an array to tabulate a set of values js const values = []; for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) { values.push([2 ** x, 2 * x ** 2]); } console.table(values); Results in // The first column is the index 0 1 0 1 2 2 2 4 8 3 8 18 4 16 32 5 32 50 6 64 72 7 128 98 8 256 128 9 512 162 Creating an array using the result of a match The result of a match between a RegExp and a string can create a JavaScript array that has properties and elements which provide information about the match. Such an array is returned by RegExp.prototype.exec() and String.prototype.match() . For example: js // Match one d followed by one or more b's followed by one d // Remember matched b's and the following d // Ignore case const myRe = /d(b+)(d)/i; const execResult = myRe.exec(\"cdbBdbsbz\"); console.log(execResult.input); // 'cdbBdbsbz' console.log(execResult.index); // 1 console.log(execResult); // [ \"dbBd\", \"bB\", \"d\" ] For more information about the result of a match, see the RegExp.prototype.exec() and String.prototype.match() pages. Mutating initial array in iterative methods Iterative methods do not mutate the array on which it is called, but the function provided as callbackFn can. The key principle to remember is that only indexes between 0 and arrayLength - 1 are visited, where arrayLength is the length of the array at the time the array method was first called, but the element passed to the callback is the value at the time the index is visited. Therefore: callbackFn will not visit any elements added beyond the array's initial length when the call to the iterative method began. Changes to already-visited indexes do not cause callbackFn to be invoked on them again. If an existing, yet-unvisited element of the array is changed by callbackFn , its value passed to the callbackFn will be the value at the time that element gets visited. Removed elements are not visited. Warning: Concurrent modifications of the kind described above frequently lead to hard-to-understand code and are generally to be avoided (except in special cases). The following examples use the forEach method as an example, but other methods that visit indexes in ascending order work in the same way. We will first define a helper function: js function testSideEffect(effect) { const arr = [\"e1\", \"e2\", \"e3\", \"e4\"]; arr.forEach((elem, index, arr) => { console.log(`array: [${arr.join(\", \")}], index: ${index}, elem: ${elem}`); effect(arr, index); }); console.log(`Final array: [${arr.join(\", \")}]`); } Modification to indexes not visited yet will be visible once the index is reached: js testSideEffect((arr, index) => { if (index + 1 < arr.length) arr[index + 1] += \"*\"; }); // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 0, elem: e1 // array: [e1, e2*, e3, e4], index: 1, elem: e2* // array: [e1, e2*, e3*, e4], index: 2, elem: e3* // array: [e1, e2*, e3*, e4*], index: 3, elem: e4* // Final array: [e1, e2*, e3*, e4*] Modification to already visited indexes does not change iteration behavior, although the array will be different afterwards: js testSideEffect((arr, index) => { if (index > 0) arr[index - 1] += \"*\"; }); // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 0, elem: e1 // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 1, elem: e2 // array: [e1*, e2, e3, e4], index: 2, elem: e3 // array: [e1*, e2*, e3, e4], index: 3, elem: e4 // Final array: [e1*, e2*, e3*, e4] Inserting n elements at unvisited indexes that are less than the initial array length will make them be visited. The last n elements in the original array that now have index greater than the initial array length will not be visited: js testSideEffect((arr, index) => { if (index === 1) arr.splice(2, 0, \"new\"); }); // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 0, elem: e1 // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 1, elem: e2 // array: [e1, e2, new, e3, e4], index: 2, elem: new // array: [e1, e2, new, e3, e4], index: 3, elem: e3 // Final array: [e1, e2, new, e3, e4] // e4 is not visited because it now has index 4 Inserting n elements with index greater than the initial array length will not make them be visited: js testSideEffect((arr) => arr.push(\"new\")); // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 0, elem: e1 // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4, new], index: 1, elem: e2 // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4, new, new], index: 2, elem: e3 // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4, new, new, new], index: 3, elem: e4 // Final array: [e1, e2, e3, e4, new, new, new, new] Inserting n elements at already visited indexes will not make them be visited, but it shifts remaining elements back by n , so the current index and the n - 1 elements before it are visited again: js testSideEffect((arr, index) => arr.splice(index, 0, \"new\")); // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 0, elem: e1 // array: [new, e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 1, elem: e1 // array: [new, new, e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 2, elem: e1 // array: [new, new, new, e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 3, elem: e1 // Final array: [new, new, new, new, e1, e2, e3, e4] // e1 keeps getting visited because it keeps getting shifted back Deleting n elements at unvisited indexes will make them not be visited anymore. Because the array has shrunk, the last n iterations will visit out-of-bounds indexes. If the method ignores non-existent indexes (see array methods and empty slots ), the last n iterations will be skipped; otherwise, they will receive undefined : js testSideEffect((arr, index) => { if (index === 1) arr.splice(2, 1); }); // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 0, elem: e1 // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 1, elem: e2 // array: [e1, e2, e4], index: 2, elem: e4 // Final array: [e1, e2, e4] // Does not visit index 3 because it's out-of-bounds // Compare this with find(), which treats nonexistent indexes as undefined: const arr2 = [\"e1\", \"e2\", \"e3\", \"e4\"]; arr2.find((elem, index, arr) => { console.log(`array: [${arr.join(\", \")}], index: ${index}, elem: ${elem}`); if (index === 1) arr.splice(2, 1); return false; }); // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 0, elem: e1 // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 1, elem: e2 // array: [e1, e2, e4], index: 2, elem: e4 // array: [e1, e2, e4], index: 3, elem: undefined Deleting n elements at already visited indexes does not change the fact that they were visited before they get deleted. Because the array has shrunk, the next n elements after the current index are skipped. If the method ignores non-existent indexes, the last n iterations will be skipped; otherwise, they will receive undefined : js testSideEffect((arr, index) => arr.splice(index, 1)); // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 0, elem: e1 // Does not visit e2 because e2 now has index 0, which has already been visited // array: [e2, e3, e4], index: 1, elem: e3 // Does not visit e4 because e4 now has index 1, which has already been visited // Final array: [e2, e4] // Index 2 is out-of-bounds, so it's not visited // Compare this with find(), which treats nonexistent indexes as undefined: const arr2 = [\"e1\", \"e2\", \"e3\", \"e4\"]; arr2.find((elem, index, arr) => { console.log(`array: [${arr.join(\", \")}], index: ${index}, elem: ${elem}`); arr.splice(index, 1); return false; }); // array: [e1, e2, e3, e4], index: 0, elem: e1 // array: [e2, e3, e4], index: 1, elem: e3 // array: [e2, e4], index: 2, elem: undefined // array: [e2, e4], index: 3, elem: undefined For methods that iterate in descending order of index, insertion causes elements to be skipped, and deletion causes elements to be visited multiple times. Adjust the code above yourself to see the effects.

Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback Boolean values can be one of two values: true or false , representing the truth value of a logical proposition. Description Boolean values are typically produced by relational operators , equality operators , and logical NOT ( ! ) . They can also be produced by functions that represent conditions, such as Array.isArray() . Note that binary logical operators such as && and || return the values of the operands, which may or may not be boolean values. Boolean values are typically used in conditional testing, such as the condition for if...else and while statements, the conditional operator ( ? : ), or the predicate return value of Array.prototype.filter() . You would rarely need to explicitly convert something to a boolean value, as JavaScript does this automatically in boolean contexts, so you can use any value as if it's a boolean, based on its truthiness . You are also encouraged to use if (condition) and if (!condition) instead of if (condition === true) or if (condition === false) in your own code so you can take advantage of this convention. However, making sure that values representing conditions are always booleans can help clarify the intent of your code. js // Do this: // This always returns a boolean value const isObject = (obj) => !!obj && typeof obj === \"object\"; // Or this: const isObject = (obj) => Boolean(obj) && typeof obj === \"object\"; // Or this: const isObject = (obj) => obj !== null && typeof obj === \"object\"; // Instead of this: // This may return falsy values that are not equal to false const isObject = (obj) => obj && typeof obj === \"object\"; Boolean primitives and Boolean objects For converting non-boolean values to boolean, use Boolean as a function or use the double NOT operator. Do not use the Boolean() constructor with new . js const good = Boolean(expression); const good2 = !!expression; js const bad = new Boolean(expression); // don't use this! This is because all objects, including a Boolean object whose wrapped value is false , are truthy and evaluate to true in places such as conditional statements. (See also the boolean coercion section below.) js if (new Boolean(true)) { console.log(\"This log is printed.\"); } if (new Boolean(false)) { console.log(\"This log is ALSO printed.\"); } const myFalse = new Boolean(false); // myFalse is a Boolean object (not the primitive value false) const g = Boolean(myFalse); // g is true const myString = new String(\"Hello\"); // myString is a String object const s = Boolean(myString); // s is true Warning: You should rarely find yourself using Boolean as a constructor. Boolean coercion Many built-in operations that expect booleans first coerce their arguments to booleans. The operation can be summarized as follows: Booleans are returned as-is. undefined turns into false . null turns into false . 0 , -0 , and NaN turn into false ; other numbers turn into true . 0n turns into false ; other BigInts turn into true . The empty string \"\" turns into false ; other strings turn into true . Symbols turn into true . All objects become true . Note: A legacy behavior makes document.all return false when used as a boolean, despite it being an object. This property is legacy and non-standard and should not be used. Note: Unlike other type conversions like string coercion or number coercion , boolean coercion does not attempt to convert objects to primitives by calling user methods. In other words, there are only a handful of values that get coerced to false â these are called falsy values. All other values are called truthy values. A value's truthiness is important when used with logical operators, conditional statements, or any boolean context. There are two ways to achieve the same effect in JavaScript. Double NOT : !!x negates x twice, which converts x to a boolean using the same algorithm as above. The Boolean() function: Boolean(x) uses the same algorithm as above to convert x . Note that truthiness is not the same as being loosely equal to true or false . js if ([]) { console.log(\"[] is truthy\"); } if ([] == false) { console.log(\"[] == false\"); } // [] is truthy // [] == false [] is truthy, but it's also loosely equal to false . It's truthy, because all objects are truthy. However, when comparing with false , which is a primitive, [] is also converted to a primitive, which is \"\" via Array.prototype.toString() . Comparing strings and booleans results in both being converted to numbers , and they both become 0 , so [] == false is true . In general, falsiness and == false differ in the following cases: NaN , undefined , and null are falsy but not loosely equal to false . \"0\" (and other string literals that are not \"\" but get coerced to 0 ) is truthy but loosely equal to false . Objects are always truthy, but their primitive representation may be loosely equal to false . Truthy values are even more unlikely to be loosely equal to true . All values are either truthy or falsy, but most values are loosely equal to neither true nor false . Constructor Boolean() Creates Boolean objects. When called as a function, it returns primitive values of type Boolean. Instance properties These properties are defined on Boolean.prototype and shared by all Boolean instances. Boolean.prototype.constructor The constructor function that created the instance object. For Boolean instances, the initial value is the Boolean constructor. Instance methods Boolean.prototype.toString() Returns a string of either true or false depending upon the value of the object. Overrides the Object.prototype.toString() method. Boolean.prototype.valueOf() Returns the primitive value of the Boolean object. Overrides the Object.prototype.valueOf() method. Examples Creating false values js const bNoParam = Boolean(); const bZero = Boolean(0); const bNull = Boolean(null); const bEmptyString = Boolean(\"\"); const bfalse = Boolean(false); Creating true values js const btrue = Boolean(true); const btrueString = Boolean(\"true\"); const bfalseString = Boolean(\"false\"); const bSuLin = Boolean(\"Su Lin\"); const bArrayProto = Boolean([]); const bObjProto = Boolean({}); Specifications Specification ECMAScriptÂ® 2026 LanguageÂ Specification # sec-boolean-objects Browser compatibility See also Boolean Boolean primitives Boolean data type on Wikipedia Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on Jul 10, 2025 by MDN contributors .

Itâs been available across browsers since July 2015. * Some parts of this feature may have varying levels of support. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback Error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur. The Error object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions. See below for standard built-in error types. Description Runtime errors result in new Error objects being created and thrown. Error is a serializable object , so it can be cloned with structuredClone() or copied between Workers using postMessage() . Error types Besides the generic Error constructor, there are other core error constructors in JavaScript. For client-side exceptions, see Exception handling statements . EvalError Creates an instance representing an error that occurs regarding the global function eval() . RangeError Creates an instance representing an error that occurs when a numeric variable or parameter is outside its valid range. ReferenceError Creates an instance representing an error that occurs when de-referencing an invalid reference. SyntaxError Creates an instance representing a syntax error. TypeError Creates an instance representing an error that occurs when a variable or parameter is not of a valid type. URIError Creates an instance representing an error that occurs when encodeURI() or decodeURI() are passed invalid parameters. AggregateError Creates an instance representing several errors wrapped in a single error when multiple errors need to be reported by an operation, for example by Promise.any() . InternalError Non-standard Creates an instance representing an error that occurs when an internal error in the JavaScript engine is thrown. E.g. \"too much recursion\". Constructor Error() Creates a new Error object. Static properties Error.stackTraceLimit Non-standard A non-standard numerical property that limits how many stack frames to include in an error stack trace. Static methods Error.captureStackTrace() A non-standard function that creates the stack property on the provided object. Error.isError() Returns true if the argument is an error, or false otherwise. Error.prepareStackTrace() Non-standard Optional A non-standard function that, if provided by user code, is called by the JavaScript engine for thrown exceptions, allowing the user to provide custom formatting for stack traces. See the V8 Stack Trace API docs. Instance properties These properties are defined on Error.prototype and shared by all Error instances. Error.prototype.constructor The constructor function that created the instance object. For Error instances, the initial value is the Error constructor. Error.prototype.name Represents the name for the type of error. For Error.prototype.name , the initial value is \"Error\" . Subclasses like TypeError and SyntaxError provide their own name properties. Error.prototype.stack Non-standard A non-standard property for a stack trace. These properties are own properties of each Error instance. cause Error cause indicating the reason why the current error is thrown â usually another caught error. For user-created Error objects, this is the value provided as the cause property of the constructor's second argument. columnNumber Non-standard A non-standard Mozilla property for the column number in the line that raised this error. fileName Non-standard A non-standard Mozilla property for the path to the file that raised this error. lineNumber Non-standard A non-standard Mozilla property for the line number in the file that raised this error. message Error message. For user-created Error objects, this is the string provided as the constructor's first argument. Instance methods Error.prototype.toString() Returns a string representing the specified object. Overrides the Object.prototype.toString() method. Examples Throwing a generic error Usually you create an Error object with the intention of raising it using the throw keyword. You can handle the error using the try...catch construct: js try { throw new Error(\"Whoops!\"); } catch (e) { console.error(`${e.name}: ${e.message}`); } Handling a specific error type You can choose to handle only specific error types by testing the error type with the instanceof keyword: js try { foo.bar(); } catch (e) { if (e instanceof EvalError) { console.error(`${e.name}: ${e.message}`); } else if (e instanceof RangeError) { console.error(`${e.name}: ${e.message}`); } // etc. else { // If none of our cases matched leave the Error unhandled throw e; } } Differentiate between similar errors Sometimes a block of code can fail for reasons that require different handling, but which throw very similar errors (i.e., with the same type and message). If you don't have control over the original errors that are thrown, one option is to catch them and throw new Error objects that have more specific messages. The original error should be passed to the new Error in the constructor's options parameter as its cause property. This ensures that the original error and stack trace are available to higher-level try/catch blocks. The example below shows this for two methods that would otherwise fail with similar errors ( doFailSomeWay() and doFailAnotherWay() ): js function doWork() { try { doFailSomeWay(); } catch (err) { throw new Error(\"Failed in some way\", { cause: err }); } try { doFailAnotherWay(); } catch (err) { throw new Error(\"Failed in another way\", { cause: err }); } } try { doWork(); } catch (err) { switch (err.message) { case \"Failed in some way\": handleFailSomeWay(err.cause); break; case \"Failed in another way\": handleFailAnotherWay(err.cause); break; } } Note: If you are making a library, you should prefer to use error cause to discriminate between different errors emitted â rather than asking your consumers to parse the error message. See the error cause page for an example. Custom error types can also use the cause property, provided the subclasses' constructor passes the options parameter when calling super() . The Error() base class constructor will read options.cause and define the cause property on the new error instance. js class MyError extends Error { constructor(message, options) { // Need to pass `options` as the second parameter to install the \"cause\" property. super(message, options); } } console.log(new MyError(\"test\", { cause: new Error(\"cause\") }).cause); // Error: cause Custom error types You might want to define your own error types deriving from Error to be able to throw new MyError() and use instanceof MyError to check the kind of error in the exception handler. This results in cleaner and more consistent error handling code. See \"What's a good way to extend Error in JavaScript?\" on Stack Overflow for an in-depth discussion. Warning: Builtin subclassing cannot be reliably transpiled to pre-ES6 code, because there's no way to construct the base class with a particular new.target without Reflect.construct() . You need additional configuration or manually call Object.setPrototypeOf(this, CustomError.prototype) at the end of the constructor; otherwise, the constructed instance will not be a CustomError instance. See the TypeScript FAQ for more information. Note: Some browsers include the CustomError constructor in the stack trace when using ES2015 classes. js class CustomError extends Error { constructor(foo = \"bar\", ...params) { // Pass remaining arguments (including vendor specific ones) to parent constructor super(...params); // Maintains proper stack trace for where our error was thrown (non-standard) if (Error.captureStackTrace) { Error.captureStackTrace(this, CustomError); } this.name = \"CustomError\"; // Custom debugging information this.foo = foo; this.date = new Date(); } } try { throw new CustomError(\"baz\", \"bazMessage\"); } catch (e) { console.error(e.name); // CustomError console.error(e.foo); // baz console.error(e.message); // bazMessage console.error(e.stack); // stack trace } Specifications Specification ECMAScriptÂ® 2026 LanguageÂ Specification # sec-error-objects Browser compatibility See also Polyfill of Error with cause support in core-js es-shims polyfill of Error cause throw try...catch Stack trace API in the V8 docs Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on Jul 10, 2025 by MDN contributors .

Itâs been available across browsers since July 2015. * Some parts of this feature may have varying levels of support. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The Function object provides methods for functions . In JavaScript, every function is actually a Function object. Constructor Function() Creates a new Function object. Calling the constructor directly can create functions dynamically but suffers from security and similar (but far less significant) performance issues to eval() . However, unlike eval() , the Function constructor creates functions that execute in the global scope only. Instance properties These properties are defined on Function.prototype and shared by all Function instances. Function.prototype.arguments Deprecated Non-standard Represents the arguments passed to this function. For strict , arrow, async, and generator functions, accessing the arguments property throws a TypeError . Use the arguments object inside function closures instead. Function.prototype.caller Deprecated Non-standard Represents the function that invoked this function. For strict , arrow, async, and generator functions, accessing the caller property throws a TypeError . Function.prototype.constructor The constructor function that created the instance object. For Function instances, the initial value is the Function constructor. These properties are own properties of each Function instance. displayName Non-standard Optional The display name of the function. length Specifies the number of arguments expected by the function. name The name of the function. prototype Used when the function is used as a constructor with the new operator. It will become the new object's prototype. Instance methods Function.prototype.apply() Calls a function with a given this value and optional arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object ). Function.prototype.bind() Creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to a provided value, optionally with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called. Function.prototype.call() Calls a function with a given this value and optional arguments. Function.prototype.toString() Returns a string representing the source code of the function. Overrides the Object.prototype.toString method. Function.prototype[Symbol.hasInstance]() Specifies the default procedure for determining if a constructor function recognizes an object as one of the constructor's instances. Called by the instanceof operator. Examples Difference between Function constructor and function declaration Functions created with the Function constructor do not create closures to their creation contexts; they always are created in the global scope. When running them, they will only be able to access their own local variables and global ones, not the ones from the scope in which the Function constructor was created. This is different from using eval() with code for a function expression. js // Create a global property with `var` var x = 10; function createFunction1() { const x = 20; return new Function(\"return x;\"); // this `x` refers to global `x` } function createFunction2() { const x = 20; function f() { return x; // this `x` refers to the local `x` above } return f; } const f1 = createFunction1(); console.log(f1()); // 10 const f2 = createFunction2(); console.log(f2()); // 20 While this code works in web browsers, f1() will produce a ReferenceError in Node.js, as x will not be found. This is because the top-level scope in Node is not the global scope, and x will be local to the module.

Itâs been available across browsers since July 2015. * Some parts of this feature may have varying levels of support. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The JSON namespace object contains static methods for parsing values from and converting values to JavaScript Object Notation ( JSON ). Description Unlike most global objects, JSON is not a constructor. You cannot use it with the new operator or invoke the JSON object as a function. All properties and methods of JSON are static (just like the Math object). JavaScript and JSON differences JSON is a syntax for serializing objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null . It is based upon JavaScript syntax, but is distinct from JavaScript: most of JavaScript is not JSON. For example: Objects and Arrays Property names must be double-quoted strings; trailing commas are forbidden. Numbers Leading zeros are prohibited. A decimal point must be followed by at least one digit. NaN and Infinity are unsupported. Any JSON text is a valid JavaScript expression, but only after the JSON superset revision. Before the revision, U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR and U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR are allowed in string literals and property keys in JSON; but the same use in JavaScript string literals is a SyntaxError . Other differences include allowing only double-quoted strings and no support for undefined or comments. For those who wish to use a more human-friendly configuration format based on JSON, there is JSON5 , used by the Babel compiler, and the more commonly used YAML . The same text may represent different values in JavaScript object literals vs. JSON as well. For more information, see Object literal syntax vs. JSON . Full JSON grammar Valid JSON syntax is formally defined by the following grammar, expressed in ABNF , and copied from IETF JSON standard (RFC) : JSON-text = ws value ws begin-array = ws %x5B ws ; [ left square bracket begin-object = ws %x7B ws ; { left curly bracket end-array = ws %x5D ws ; ] right square bracket end-object = ws %x7D ws ; } right curly bracket name-separator = ws %x3A ws ; : colon value-separator = ws %x2C ws ; , comma ws = *( %x20 / ; Space %x09 / ; Horizontal tab %x0A / ; Line feed or New line %x0D ; Carriage return ) value = false / null / true / object / array / number / string false = %x66.61.6c.73.65 ; false null = %x6e.75.6c.6c ; null true = %x74.72.75.65 ; true object = begin-object [ member *( value-separator member ) ] end-object member = string name-separator value array = begin-array [ value *( value-separator value ) ] end-array number = [ minus ] int [ frac ] [ exp ] decimal-point = %x2E ; . digit1-9 = %x31-39 ; 1-9 e = %x65 / %x45 ; e E exp = e [ minus / plus ] 1*DIGIT frac = decimal-point 1*DIGIT int = zero / ( digit1-9 *DIGIT ) minus = %x2D ; - plus = %x2B ; + zero = %x30 ; 0 string = quotation-mark *char quotation-mark char = unescaped / escape ( %x22 / ; \" quotation mark U+0022 %x5C / ; \\ reverse solidus U+005C %x2F / ; / solidus U+002F %x62 / ; b backspace U+0008 %x66 / ; f form feed U+000C %x6E / ; n line feed U+000A %x72 / ; r carriage return U+000D %x74 / ; t tab U+0009 %x75 4HEXDIG ) ; uXXXX U+XXXX escape = %x5C ; \\ quotation-mark = %x22 ; \" unescaped = %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-10FFFF HEXDIG = DIGIT / %x41-46 / %x61-66 ; 0-9, A-F, or a-f ; HEXDIG equivalent to HEXDIG rule in [RFC5234] DIGIT = %x30-39 ; 0-9 ; DIGIT equivalent to DIGIT rule in [RFC5234] Insignificant whitespace may be present anywhere except within a JSONNumber (numbers must contain no whitespace) or JSONString (where it is interpreted as the corresponding character in the string, or would cause an error). The tab (U+0009), carriage return (U+000D), line feed (U+000A), and space (U+0020) characters are the only valid whitespace characters. Static properties JSON[Symbol.toStringTag] The initial value of the [Symbol.toStringTag] property is the string \"JSON\" . This property is used in Object.prototype.toString() . Static methods JSON.isRawJSON() Tests whether a value is an object returned by JSON.rawJSON() . JSON.parse() Parse a piece of string text as JSON, optionally transforming the produced value and its properties, and return the value. JSON.rawJSON() Creates a \"raw JSON\" object containing a piece of JSON text. When serialized to JSON, the raw JSON object is treated as if it is already a piece of JSON. This text is required to be valid JSON. JSON.stringify() Return a JSON string corresponding to the specified value, optionally including only certain properties or replacing property values in a user-defined manner. Examples Example JSON json { \"browsers\": { \"firefox\": { \"name\": \"Firefox\", \"pref_url\": \"about:config\", \"releases\": { \"1\": { \"release_date\": \"2004-11-09\", \"status\": \"retired\", \"engine\": \"Gecko\", \"engine_version\": \"1.7\" } } } } } You can use the JSON.parse() method to convert the above JSON string into a JavaScript object: js const jsonText = `{ \"browsers\": { \"firefox\": { \"name\": \"Firefox\", \"pref_url\": \"about:config\", \"releases\": { \"1\": { \"release_date\": \"2004-11-09\", \"status\": \"retired\", \"engine\": \"Gecko\", \"engine_version\": \"1.7\" } } } } }`; console.log(JSON.parse(jsonText)); Lossless number serialization JSON can contain number literals of arbitrary precision. However, it is not possible to represent all JSON numbers exactly in JavaScript, because JavaScript uses floating point representation which has a fixed precision. For example, 12345678901234567890 === 12345678901234567000 in JavaScript because they have the same floating point representation. This means there is no JavaScript number that corresponds precisely to the 12345678901234567890 JSON number. Let's assume you have an exact representation of some number (either via BigInt or a custom library): js const data = { // Using a BigInt here to store the exact value, // but it can also be a custom high-precision number library, // if the number might not be an integer. gross_gdp: 12345678901234567890n, }; You want to serialize it and then parse to the same exact number. There are several difficulties: On the serialization side, in order to obtain a number in JSON, you have to pass a number to JSON.stringify , either via the replacer function or via the toJSON method. But, in either case, you have already lost precision during number conversion. If you pass a string to JSON.stringify , it will be serialized as a string, not a number. On the parsing side, not all numbers can be represented exactly. For example, JSON.parse(\"12345678901234567890\") returns 12345678901234568000 because the number is rounded to the nearest representable number. Even if you use a reviver function, the number will already be rounded before the reviver function is called. There are, in general, two ways to ensure that numbers are losslessly converted to JSON and parsed back: one involves a JSON number, another involves a JSON string. JSON is a communication format , so if you use JSON, you are likely communicating with another system (HTTP request, storing in database, etc.). The best solution to choose depends on the recipient system. Using JSON strings If the recipient system does not have same JSON-handling capabilities as JavaScript, and does not support high precision numbers, you may want to serialize the number as a string, and then handle it as a string on the recipient side. This is also the only option in older JavaScript. To specify how custom data types (including BigInt ) should be serialized to JSON, either add a toJSON method to your data type, or use the replacer function of JSON.stringify() . js // Using toJSON() method BigInt.prototype.toJSON = function () { return this.toString(); }; const str1 = JSON.stringify(data); // Using JSON.stringify() with replacer const str2 = JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) => { if (key === \"gross_gdp\") { return value.toString(); } return value; }); In either case, the JSON text will look like {\"gross_gdp\":\"12345678901234567890\"} , where the value is a string, not a number. Then, on the recipient side, you can parse the JSON and handle the string. Using JSON numbers If the recipient of this message natively supports high precision numbers (such as Python integers), passing numbers as JSON numbers is obviously better, because they can directly parse to the high precision type instead of parsing a string from JSON, and then parsing a number from the string. In JavaScript, you can serialize arbitrary data types to JSON numbers without producing a number value first (resulting in loss of precision) by using JSON.rawJSON() to precisely specify what the JSON source text should be. js // Using toJSON() method BigInt.prototype.toJSON = function () { return JSON.rawJSON(this.toString()); }; const str1 = JSON.stringify(data); // Using JSON.stringify() with replacer const str2 = JSON.stringify(data, (key, value) => { if (key === \"gross_gdp\") { return JSON.rawJSON(value.toString()); } return value; }); The text passed to JSON.rawJSON is treated as if it is already a piece of JSON, so it won't be serialized again as a string. Therefore, the JSON text will look like {\"gross_gdp\":12345678901234567890} , where the value is a number. This JSON can then be parsed by the recipient without any extra processing, provided that the recipient system does not have the same precision limitations as JavaScript. When parsing JSON containing high-precision numbers in JavaScript, take extra care because when JSON.parse() invokes the reviver function, the value you receive is already parsed (and has lost precision). You can use the context.source parameter of the JSON.parse() reviver function to re-parse the number yourself. js const parsedData = JSON.parse(str, (key, value, context) => { if (key === \"gross_gdp\") { // Or use the constructor of your custom high-precision number library return BigInt(context.source); } return value; }); // { gross_gdp: 12345678901234567890n } Specifications Specification ECMAScriptÂ® 2026 LanguageÂ Specification # sec-json-object Browser compatibility See also JSON Diff JSON Beautifier/editor JSON Parser JSON Validator Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on Nov 20, 2025 by MDN contributors .

      "text_content": "Math Baseline Widely available * This feature is well established and works across many devices and browser versions. Itâs been available across browsers since July 2015. * Some parts of this feature may have varying levels of support. Learn more See full compatibility Report feedback The Math namespace object contains static properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. Math works with the Number type. It doesn't work with BigInt . Description Unlike most global objects, Math is not a constructor. You cannot use it with the new operator or invoke the Math object as a function. All properties and methods of Math are static. Note: Many Math functions have a precision that's implementation-dependent . This means that different browsers can give a different result. Even the same JavaScript engine on a different OS or architecture can give different results! Static properties Math.E Euler's number and the base of natural logarithms; approximately 2.718 . Math.LN10 Natural logarithm of 10 ; approximately 2.303 . Math.LN2 Natural logarithm of 2 ; approximately 0.693 . Math.LOG10E Base-10 logarithm of E ; approximately 0.434 . Math.LOG2E Base-2 logarithm of E ; approximately 1.443 . Math.PI Ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter; approximately 3.14159 . Math.SQRT1_2 Square root of Â½; approximately 0.707 . Math.SQRT2 Square root of 2 ; approximately 1.414 . Math[Symbol.toStringTag] The initial value of the [Symbol.toStringTag] property is the string \"Math\" . This property is used in Object.prototype.toString() . Static methods Math.abs() Returns the absolute value of the input. Math.acos() Returns the arccosine of the input. Math.acosh() Returns the hyperbolic arccosine of the input. Math.asin() Returns the arcsine of the input. Math.asinh() Returns the hyperbolic arcsine of a number. Math.atan() Returns the arctangent of the input. Math.atan2() Returns the arctangent of the quotient of its arguments. Math.atanh() Returns the hyperbolic arctangent of the input. Math.cbrt() Returns the cube root of the input. Math.ceil() Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the input. Math.clz32() Returns the number of leading zero bits of the 32-bit integer input. Math.cos() Returns the cosine of the input. Math.cosh() Returns the hyperbolic cosine of the input. Math.exp() Returns e x , where x is the argument, and e is Euler's number ( 2.718 â¦, the base of the natural logarithm). Math.expm1() Returns subtracting 1 from exp(x) . Math.floor() Returns the largest integer less than or equal to the input. Math.f16round() Returns the nearest half precision float representation of the input. Math.fround() Returns the nearest single precision float representation of the input. Math.hypot() Returns the square root of the sum of squares of its arguments. Math.imul() Returns the result of the 32-bit integer multiplication of the inputs. Math.log() Returns the natural logarithm (ã e ; also, ã) of the input. Math.log10() Returns the base-10 logarithm of the input. Math.log1p() Returns the natural logarithm (ã e ; also ã) of 1 + x for the number x . Math.log2() Returns the base-2 logarithm of the input. Math.max() Returns the largest of zero or more numbers. Math.min() Returns the smallest of zero or more numbers. Math.pow() Returns base x to the exponent power y (that is, x y ). Math.random() Returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1 . Math.round() Returns the value of the input rounded to the nearest integer. Math.sign() Returns the sign of the input, indicating whether it is positive, negative, or zero. Math.sin() Returns the sine of the input. Math.sinh() Returns the hyperbolic sine of the input. Math.sqrt() Returns the positive square root of the input. Math.sumPrecise() Returns the sum of a passed iterable of numbers, avoiding floating point precision loss in intermediate results. Math.tan() Returns the tangent of the input. Math.tanh() Returns the hyperbolic tangent of the input. Math.trunc() Returns the integer portion of the input, removing any fractional digits. Examples Converting between degrees and radians The trigonometric functions sin() , cos() , tan() , asin() , acos() , atan() , and atan2() expect (and return) angles in radians . Since humans tend to think in degrees, and some functions (such as CSS transforms) can accept degrees, it is a good idea to keep functions handy that convert between the two: js function degToRad(degrees) { return degrees * (Math.PI / 180); } function radToDeg(rad) { return rad / (Math.PI / 180); } Calculating the height of an equilateral triangle If we want to calculate the height of an equilateral triangle, and we know its side length is 100, we can use the formulae length of the adjacent multiplied by the tangent of the angle is equal to the opposite. In JavaScript, we can do this with the following: js 50 * Math.tan(degToRad(60)); We use our degToRad() function to convert 60 degrees to radians, as Math.tan() expects an input value in radians. Returning a random integer between two bounds This can be achieved with a combination of Math.random() and Math.floor() : js function random(min, max) { const num = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min; return num; } random(1, 10); Specifications Specification ECMAScriptÂ® 2026 LanguageÂ Specification # sec-math-object Browser compatibility See also Number Help improve MDN Learn how to contribute This page was last modified on Jul 10, 2025 by MDN contributors .
