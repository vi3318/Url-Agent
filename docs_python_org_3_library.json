      "text_content": "The Python Standard Library Â¶ While The Python Language Reference describes the exact syntax and semantics of the Python language, this library reference manual describes the standard library that is distributed with Python. It also describes some of the optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions. Pythonâs standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs. The Python installers for the Windows platform usually include the entire standard library and often also include many additional components. For Unix-like operating systems Python is normally provided as a collection of packages, so it may be necessary to use the packaging tools provided with the operating system to obtain some or all of the optional components. In addition to the standard library, there is an active collection of hundreds of thousands of components (from individual programs and modules to packages and entire application development frameworks), available from the Python Package Index .

      "text_content": "Introduction Â¶ The âPython libraryâ contains several different kinds of components. It contains data types that would normally be considered part of the âcoreâ of a language, such as numbers and lists. For these types, the Python language core defines the form of literals and places some constraints on their semantics, but does not fully define the semantics. (On the other hand, the language core does define syntactic properties like the spelling and priorities of operators.) The library also contains built-in functions and exceptions â objects that can be used by all Python code without the need of an import statement. Some of these are defined by the core language, but many are not essential for the core semantics and are only described here. The bulk of the library, however, consists of a collection of modules. There are many ways to dissect this collection. Some modules are written in C and built in to the Python interpreter; others are written in Python and imported in source form. Some modules provide interfaces that are highly specific to Python, like printing a stack trace; some provide interfaces that are specific to particular operating systems, such as access to specific hardware; others provide interfaces that are specific to a particular application domain, like the World Wide Web. Some modules are available in all versions and ports of Python; others are only available when the underlying system supports or requires them; yet others are available only when a particular configuration option was chosen at the time when Python was compiled and installed. This manual is organized âfrom the inside out:â it first describes the built-in functions, data types and exceptions, and finally the modules, grouped in chapters of related modules. This means that if you start reading this manual from the start, and skip to the next chapter when you get bored, you will get a reasonable overview of the available modules and application areas that are supported by the Python library. Of course, you donât have to read it like a novel â you can also browse the table of contents (in front of the manual), or look for a specific function, module or term in the index (in the back). And finally, if you enjoy learning about random subjects, you choose a random page number (see module random ) and read a section or two. Regardless of the order in which you read the sections of this manual, it helps to start with chapter Built-in Functions , as the remainder of the manual assumes familiarity with this material. Let the show begin! Notes on availability Â¶ An âAvailability: Unixâ note means that this function is commonly found on Unix systems. It does not make any claims about its existence on a specific operating system. If not separately noted, all functions that claim âAvailability: Unixâ are supported on macOS, iOS and Android, all of which build on a Unix core. If an availability note contains both a minimum Kernel version and a minimum libc version, then both conditions must hold. For example a feature with note Availability: Linux >= 3.17 with glibc >= 2.27 requires both Linux 3.17 or newer and glibc 2.27 or newer. WebAssembly platforms Â¶ The WebAssembly platforms wasm32-emscripten ( Emscripten ) and wasm32-wasi ( WASI ) provide a subset of POSIX APIs. WebAssembly runtimes and browsers are sandboxed and have limited access to the host and external resources. Any Python standard library module that uses processes, threading, networking, signals, or other forms of inter-process communication (IPC), is either not available or may not work as on other Unix-like systems. File I/O, file system, and Unix permission-related functions are restricted, too. Emscripten does not permit blocking I/O. Other blocking operations like sleep() block the browser event loop. The properties and behavior of Python on WebAssembly platforms depend on the Emscripten -SDK or WASI -SDK version, WASM runtimes (browser, NodeJS, wasmtime ), and Python build time flags. WebAssembly, Emscripten, and WASI are evolving standards; some features like networking may be supported in the future. For Python in the browser, users should consider Pyodide or PyScript . PyScript is built on top of Pyodide, which itself is built on top of CPython and Emscripten. Pyodide provides access to browsersâ JavaScript and DOM APIs as well as limited networking capabilities with JavaScriptâs XMLHttpRequest and Fetch APIs. Process-related APIs are not available or always fail with an error. That includes APIs that spawn new processes ( fork() , execve() ), wait for processes ( waitpid() ), send signals ( kill() ), or otherwise interact with processes. The subprocess is importable but does not work. The socket module is available, but is limited and behaves differently from other platforms. On Emscripten, sockets are always non-blocking and require additional JavaScript code and helpers on the server to proxy TCP through WebSockets; see Emscripten Networking for more information. WASI snapshot preview 1 only permits sockets from an existing file descriptor. Some functions are stubs that either donât do anything and always return hardcoded values. Functions related to file descriptors, file permissions, file ownership, and links are limited and donât support some operations. For example, WASI does not permit symlinks with absolute file names. Mobile platforms Â¶ Android and iOS are, in most respects, POSIX operating systems. File I/O, socket handling, and threading all behave as they would on any POSIX operating system. However, there are several major differences: Mobile platforms can only use Python in âembeddedâ mode. There is no Python REPL, and no ability to use separate executables such as python or pip . To add Python code to your mobile app, you must use the Python embedding API . For more details, see Using Python on Android and Using Python on iOS . Subprocesses: On Android, creating subprocesses is possible but officially unsupported . In particular, Android does not support any part of the System V IPC API, so multiprocessing is not available. An iOS app cannot use any form of subprocessing, multiprocessing, or inter-process communication. If an iOS app attempts to create a subprocess, the process creating the subprocess will either lock up, or crash. An iOS app has no visibility of other applications that are running, nor any ability to communicate with other running applications, outside of the iOS-specific APIs that exist for this purpose. Mobile apps have limited access to modify system resources (such as the system clock). These resources will often be readable , but attempts to modify those resources will usually fail. Console input and output: On Android, the native stdout and stderr are not connected to anything, so Python installs its own streams which redirect messages to the system log. These can be seen under the tags python.stdout and python.stderr respectively. iOS apps have a limited concept of console output. stdout and stderr exist , and content written to stdout and stderr will be visible in logs when running in Xcode, but this content wonât be recorded in the system log. If a user who has installed your app provides their app logs as a diagnostic aid, they will not include any detail written to stdout or stderr . Mobile apps have no usable stdin at all. While apps can display an on-screen keyboard, this is a software feature, not something that is attached to stdin . As a result, Python modules that involve console manipulation (such as curses and readline ) are not available on mobile platforms.",

The argument may be an integer, a floating-point number, or an object implementing __abs__() . If the argument is a complex number, its magnitude is returned. aiter ( async_iterable , / ) Â¶ Return an asynchronous iterator for an asynchronous iterable . Equivalent to calling x.__aiter__() . Note: Unlike iter() , aiter() has no 2-argument variant. Added in version 3.10. all ( iterable , / ) Â¶ Return True if all elements of the iterable are true (or if the iterable is empty). Equivalent to: def all ( iterable ): for element in iterable : if not element : return False return True awaitable anext ( async_iterator , / ) Â¶ awaitable anext ( async_iterator , default , / ) When awaited, return the next item from the given asynchronous iterator , or default if given and the iterator is exhausted. This is the async variant of the next() builtin, and behaves similarly. This calls the __anext__() method of async_iterator , returning an awaitable . Awaiting this returns the next value of the iterator. If default is given, it is returned if the iterator is exhausted, otherwise StopAsyncIteration is raised. Added in version 3.10. any ( iterable , / ) Â¶ Return True if any element of the iterable is true. If the iterable is empty, return False . Equivalent to: def any ( iterable ): for element in iterable : if element : return True return False ascii ( object , / ) Â¶ As repr() , return a string containing a printable representation of an object, but escape the non-ASCII characters in the string returned by repr() using \\x , \\u , or \\U escapes. This generates a string similar to that returned by repr() in Python 2. bin ( integer , / ) Â¶ Convert an integer number to a binary string prefixed with â0bâ. The result is a valid Python expression. If integer is not a Python int object, it has to define an __index__() method that returns an integer. Some examples: >>> bin ( 3 ) '0b11' >>> bin ( - 10 ) '-0b1010' If the prefix â0bâ is desired or not, you can use either of the following ways. >>> format ( 14 , '#b' ), format ( 14 , 'b' ) ('0b1110', '1110') >>> f ' { 14 : #b } ' , f ' { 14 : b } ' ('0b1110', '1110') See also enum.bin() to represent negative values as twos-complement. See also format() for more information. class bool ( object = False , / ) Â¶ Return a Boolean value, i.e. one of True or False . The argument is converted using the standard truth testing procedure . If the argument is false or omitted, this returns False ; otherwise, it returns True . The bool class is a subclass of int (see Numeric Types â int, float, complex ). It cannot be subclassed further. Its only instances are False and True (see Boolean Type - bool ). Changed in version 3.7: The parameter is now positional-only. breakpoint ( * args , ** kws ) Â¶ This function drops you into the debugger at the call site. Specifically, it calls sys.breakpointhook() , passing args and kws straight through. By default, sys.breakpointhook() calls pdb.set_trace() expecting no arguments. In this case, it is purely a convenience function so you donât have to explicitly import pdb or type as much code to enter the debugger. However, sys.breakpointhook() can be set to some other function and breakpoint() will automatically call that, allowing you to drop into the debugger of choice. If sys.breakpointhook() is not accessible, this function will raise RuntimeError . By default, the behavior of breakpoint() can be changed with the PYTHONBREAKPOINT environment variable. See sys.breakpointhook() for usage details. Note that this is not guaranteed if sys.breakpointhook() has been replaced. Raises an auditing event builtins.breakpoint with argument breakpointhook . Added in version 3.7. class bytearray ( source = b'' ) class bytearray ( source , encoding , errors = 'strict' ) Return a new array of bytes. The bytearray class is a mutable sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256. It has most of the usual methods of mutable sequences, described in Mutable Sequence Types , as well as most methods that the bytes type has, see Bytes and Bytearray Operations . The optional source parameter can be used to initialize the array in a few different ways: If it is a string , you must also give the encoding (and optionally, errors ) parameters; bytearray() then converts the string to bytes using str.encode() . If it is an integer , the array will have that size and will be initialized with null bytes. If it is an object conforming to the buffer interface , a read-only buffer of the object will be used to initialize the bytes array. If it is an iterable , it must be an iterable of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256 , which are used as the initial contents of the array. Without an argument, an array of size 0 is created. See also Binary Sequence Types â bytes, bytearray, memoryview and Bytearray Objects . class bytes ( source = b'' ) class bytes ( source , encoding , errors = 'strict' ) Return a new âbytesâ object which is an immutable sequence of integers in the range 0 <= x < 256 . bytes is an immutable version of bytearray â it has the same non-mutating methods and the same indexing and slicing behavior. Accordingly, constructor arguments are interpreted as for bytearray() . Bytes objects can also be created with literals, see String and Bytes literals . See also Binary Sequence Types â bytes, bytearray, memoryview , Bytes Objects , and Bytes and Bytearray Operations . callable ( object , / ) Â¶ Return True if the object argument appears callable, False if not. If this returns True , it is still possible that a call fails, but if it is False , calling object will never succeed. Note that classes are callable (calling a class returns a new instance); instances are callable if their class has a __call__() method. Added in version 3.2: This function was first removed in Python 3.0 and then brought back in Python 3.2. chr ( codepoint , / ) Â¶ Return the string representing a character with the specified Unicode code point. For example, chr(97) returns the string 'a' , while chr(8364) returns the string 'â¬' . This is the inverse of ord() . The valid range for the argument is from 0 through 1,114,111 (0x10FFFF in base 16). ValueError will be raised if it is outside that range. @ classmethod Â¶ Transform a method into a class method. A class method receives the class as an implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance. To declare a class method, use this idiom: class C : @classmethod def f ( cls , arg1 , arg2 ): ... The @classmethod form is a function decorator â see Function definitions for details. A class method can be called either on the class (such as C.f() ) or on an instance (such as C().f() ). The instance is ignored except for its class. If a class method is called for a derived class, the derived class object is passed as the implied first argument. Class methods are different than C++ or Java static methods. If you want those, see staticmethod() in this section. For more information on class methods, see The standard type hierarchy . Changed in version 3.9: Class methods can now wrap other descriptors such as property() . Changed in version 3.10: Class methods now inherit the method attributes ( __module__ , __name__ , __qualname__ , __doc__ and __annotations__ ) and have a new __wrapped__ attribute. Deprecated since version 3.11, removed in version 3.13: Class methods can no longer wrap other descriptors such as property() . compile ( source , filename , mode , flags = 0 , dont_inherit = False , optimize = -1 ) Â¶ Compile the source into a code or AST object. Code objects can be executed by exec() or eval() . source can either be a normal string, a byte string, or an AST object. Refer to the ast module documentation for information on how to work with AST objects. The filename argument should give the file from which the code was read; pass some recognizable value if it wasnât read from a file ( '<string>' is commonly used). The mode argument specifies what kind of code must be compiled; it can be 'exec' if source consists of a sequence of statements, 'eval' if it consists of a single expression, or 'single' if it consists of a single interactive statement (in the latter case, expression statements that evaluate to something other than None will be printed). The optional arguments flags and dont_inherit control which compiler options should be activated and which future features should be allowed. If neither is present (or both are zero) the code is compiled with the same flags that affect the code that is calling compile() . If the flags argument is given and dont_inherit is not (or is zero) then the compiler options and the future statements specified by the flags argument are used in addition to those that would be used anyway. If dont_inherit is a non-zero integer then the flags argument is it â the flags (future features and compiler options) in the surrounding code are ignored. Compiler options and future statements are specified by bits which can be bitwise ORed together to specify multiple options. The bitfield required to specify a given future feature can be found as the compiler_flag attribute on the _Feature instance in the __future__ module. Compiler flags can be found in ast module, with PyCF_ prefix. The argument optimize specifies the optimization level of the compiler; the default value of -1 selects the optimization level of the interpreter as given by -O options. Explicit levels are 0 (no optimization; __debug__ is true), 1 (asserts are removed, __debug__ is false) or 2 (docstrings are removed too). This function raises SyntaxError or ValueError if the compiled source is invalid. If you want to parse Python code into its AST representation, see ast.parse() . Raises an auditing event compile with arguments source and filename . This event may also be raised by implicit compilation. Note When compiling a string with multi-line code in 'single' or 'eval' mode, input must be terminated by at least one newline character. This is to facilitate detection of incomplete and complete statements in the code module. Warning It is possible to crash the Python interpreter with a sufficiently large/complex string when compiling to an AST object due to stack depth limitations in Pythonâs AST compiler. Changed in version 3.2: Allowed use of Windows and Mac newlines. Also, input in 'exec' mode does not have to end in a newline anymore. Added the optimize parameter. Changed in version 3.5: Previously, TypeError was raised when null bytes were encountered in source . Added in version 3.8: ast.PyCF_ALLOW_TOP_LEVEL_AWAIT can now be passed in flags to enable support for top-level await , async for , and async with . class complex ( number = 0 , / ) Â¶ class complex ( string , / ) class complex ( real = 0 , imag = 0 ) Convert a single string or number to a complex number, or create a complex number from real and imaginary parts. Examples: >>> complex ( '+1.23' ) (1.23+0j) >>> complex ( '-4.5j' ) -4.5j >>> complex ( '-1.23+4.5j' ) (-1.23+4.5j) >>> complex ( ' \\t ( -1.23+4.5J ) \\n ' ) (-1.23+4.5j) >>> complex ( '-Infinity+NaNj' ) (-inf+nanj) >>> complex ( 1.23 ) (1.23+0j) >>> complex ( imag =- 4.5 ) -4.5j >>> complex ( - 1.23 , 4.5 ) (-1.23+4.5j) If the argument is a string, it must contain either a real part (in the same format as for float() ) or an imaginary part (in the same format but with a 'j' or 'J' suffix), or both real and imaginary parts (the sign of the imaginary part is mandatory in this case). The string can optionally be surrounded by whitespaces and the round parentheses '(' and ')' , which are ignored. The string must not contain whitespace between '+' , '-' , the 'j' or 'J' suffix, and the decimal number. For example, complex('1+2j') is fine, but complex('1 + 2j') raises ValueError . More precisely, the input must conform to the complexvalue production rule in the following grammar, after parentheses and leading and trailing whitespace characters are removed: complexvalue : floatvalue | floatvalue ( \"j\" | \"J\" ) | floatvalue sign absfloatvalue ( \"j\" | \"J\" ) If the argument is a number, the constructor serves as a numeric conversion like int and float . For a general Python object x , complex(x) delegates to x.__complex__() . If __complex__() is not defined then it falls back to __float__() . If __float__() is not defined then it falls back to __index__() . If two arguments are provided or keyword arguments are used, each argument may be any numeric type (including complex). If both arguments are real numbers, return a complex number with the real component real and the imaginary component imag . If both arguments are complex numbers, return a complex number with the real component real.real-imag.imag and the imaginary component real.imag+imag.real . If one of arguments is a real number, only its real component is used in the above expressions. See also complex.from_number() which only accepts a single numeric argument. If all arguments are omitted, returns 0j . The complex type is described in Numeric Types â int, float, complex . Changed in version 3.6: Grouping digits with underscores as in code literals is allowed. Changed in version 3.8: Falls back to __index__() if __complex__() and __float__() are not defined. Deprecated since version 3.14: Passing a complex number as the real or imag argument is now deprecated; it should only be passed as a single positional argument. delattr ( object , name , / ) Â¶ This is a relative of setattr() . The arguments are an object and a string. The string must be the name of one of the objectâs attributes. The function deletes the named attribute, provided the object allows it. For example, delattr(x, 'foobar') is equivalent to del x.foobar . name need not be a Python identifier (see setattr() ). class dict ( ** kwargs ) class dict ( mapping , / , ** kwargs ) class dict ( iterable , / , ** kwargs ) Create a new dictionary. The dict object is the dictionary class. See dict and Mapping Types â dict for documentation about this class. For other containers see the built-in list , set , and tuple classes, as well as the collections module. dir ( ) Â¶ dir ( object , / ) Without arguments, return the list of names in the current local scope. With an argument, attempt to return a list of valid attributes for that object. If the object has a method named __dir__() , this method will be called and must return the list of attributes. This allows objects that implement a custom __getattr__() or __getattribute__() function to customize the way dir() reports their attributes. If the object does not provide __dir__() , the function tries its best to gather information from the objectâs __dict__ attribute, if defined, and from its type object. The resulting list is not necessarily complete and may be inaccurate when the object has a custom __getattr__() . The default dir() mechanism behaves differently with different types of objects, as it attempts to produce the most relevant, rather than complete, information: If the object is a module object, the list contains the names of the moduleâs attributes. If the object is a type or class object, the list contains the names of its attributes, and recursively of the attributes of its bases. Otherwise, the list contains the objectâs attributesâ names, the names of its classâs attributes, and recursively of the attributes of its classâs base classes. The resulting list is sorted alphabetically. For example: >>> import struct >>> dir () # show the names in the module namespace ['__builtins__', '__name__', 'struct'] >>> dir ( struct ) # show the names in the struct module ['Struct', '__all__', '__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__initializing__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '_clearcache', 'calcsize', 'error', 'pack', 'pack_into', 'unpack', 'unpack_from'] >>> class Shape : ... def __dir__ ( self ): ... return [ 'area' , 'perimeter' , 'location' ] ... >>> s = Shape () >>> dir ( s ) ['area', 'location', 'perimeter'] Note Because dir() is supplied primarily as a convenience for use at an interactive prompt, it tries to supply an interesting set of names more than it tries to supply a rigorously or consistently defined set of names, and its detailed behavior may change across releases. For example, metaclass attributes are not in the result list when the argument is a class. divmod ( a , b , / ) Â¶ Take two (non-complex) numbers as arguments and return a pair of numbers consisting of their quotient and remainder when using integer division. With mixed operand types, the rules for binary arithmetic operators apply. For integers, the result is the same as (a // b, a % b) . For floating-point numbers the result is (q, a % b) , where q is usually math.floor(a / b) but may be 1 less than that. In any case q * b + a % b is very close to a , if a % b is non-zero it has the same sign as b , and 0 <= abs(a % b) < abs(b) . enumerate ( iterable , start = 0 ) Â¶ Return an enumerate object. iterable must be a sequence, an iterator , or some other object which supports iteration. The __next__() method of the iterator returned by enumerate() returns a tuple containing a count (from start which defaults to 0) and the values obtained from iterating over iterable . >>> seasons = [ 'Spring' , 'Summer' , 'Fall' , 'Winter' ] >>> list ( enumerate ( seasons )) [(0, 'Spring'), (1, 'Summer'), (2, 'Fall'), (3, 'Winter')] >>> list ( enumerate ( seasons , start = 1 )) [(1, 'Spring'), (2, 'Summer'), (3, 'Fall'), (4, 'Winter')] Equivalent to: def enumerate ( iterable , start = 0 ): n = start for elem in iterable : yield n , elem n += 1 eval ( source , / , globals = None , locals = None ) Â¶ Parameters : source ( str | code object ) â A Python expression. globals ( dict | None ) â The global namespace (default: None ). locals ( mapping | None ) â The local namespace (default: None ). Returns : The result of the evaluated expression. Raises : Syntax errors are reported as exceptions. Warning This function executes arbitrary code. Calling it with user-supplied input may lead to security vulnerabilities. The source argument is parsed and evaluated as a Python expression (technically speaking, a condition list) using the globals and locals mappings as global and local namespace. If the globals dictionary is present and does not contain a value for the key __builtins__ , a reference to the dictionary of the built-in module builtins is inserted under that key before source is parsed. That way you can control what builtins are available to the executed code by inserting your own __builtins__ dictionary into globals before passing it to eval() . If the locals mapping is omitted it defaults to the globals dictionary. If both mappings are omitted, the source is executed with the globals and locals in the environment where eval() is called. Note, eval() will only have access to the nested scopes (non-locals) in the enclosing environment if they are already referenced in the scope that is calling eval() (e.g. via a nonlocal statement). Example: >>> x = 1 >>> eval ( 'x+1' ) 2 This function can also be used to execute arbitrary code objects (such as those created by compile() ). In this case, pass a code object instead of a string. If the code object has been compiled with 'exec' as the mode argument, eval() 's return value will be None . Hints: dynamic execution of statements is supported by the exec() function. The globals() and locals() functions return the current global and local dictionary, respectively, which may be useful to pass around for use by eval() or exec() . If the given source is a string, then leading and trailing spaces and tabs are stripped. See ast.literal_eval() for a function that can safely evaluate strings with expressions containing only literals. Raises an auditing event exec with the code object as the argument. Code compilation events may also be raised. Changed in version 3.13: The globals and locals arguments can now be passed as keywords. Changed in version 3.13: The semantics of the default locals namespace have been adjusted as described for the locals() builtin. exec ( source , / , globals = None , locals = None , * , closure = None ) Â¶ Warning This function executes arbitrary code. Calling it with user-supplied input may lead to security vulnerabilities. This function supports dynamic execution of Python code. source must be either a string or a code object. If it is a string, the string is parsed as a suite of Python statements which is then executed (unless a syntax error occurs). [ 1 ] If it is a code object, it is simply executed. In all cases, the code thatâs executed is expected to be valid as file input (see the section File input in the Reference Manual). Be aware that the nonlocal , yield , and return statements may not be used outside of function definitions even within the context of code passed to the exec() function. The return value is None . In all cases, if the optional parts are omitted, the code is executed in the current scope. If only globals is provided, it must be a dictionary (and not a subclass of dictionary), which will be used for both the global and the local variables. If globals and locals are given, they are used for the global and local variables, respectively. If provided, locals can be any mapping object. Remember that at the module level, globals and locals are the same dictionary. Note When exec gets two separate objects as globals and locals , the code will be executed as if it were embedded in a class definition. This means functions and classes defined in the executed code will not be able to access variables assigned at the top level (as the âtop levelâ variables are treated as class variables in a class definition). If the globals dictionary does not contain a value for the key __builtins__ , a reference to the dictionary of the built-in module builtins is inserted under that key. That way you can control what builtins are available to the executed code by inserting your own __builtins__ dictionary into globals before passing it to exec() . The closure argument specifies a closureâa tuple of cellvars. Itâs only valid when the object is a code object containing free (closure) variables . The length of the tuple must exactly match the length of the code objectâs co_freevars attribute. Raises an auditing event exec with the code object as the argument. Code compilation events may also be raised. Note The built-in functions globals() and locals() return the current global and local namespace, respectively, which may be useful to pass around for use as the second and third argument to exec() . Note The default locals act as described for function locals() below. Pass an explicit locals dictionary if you need to see effects of the code on locals after function exec() returns. Changed in version 3.11: Added the closure parameter. Changed in version 3.13: The globals and locals arguments can now be passed as keywords. Changed in version 3.13: The semantics of the default locals namespace have been adjusted as described for the locals() builtin. filter ( function , iterable , / ) Â¶ Construct an iterator from those elements of iterable for which function is true. iterable may be either a sequence, a container which supports iteration, or an iterator. If function is None , the identity function is assumed, that is, all elements of iterable that are false are removed. Note that filter(function, iterable) is equivalent to the generator expression (item for item in iterable if function(item)) if function is not None and (item for item in iterable if item) if function is None . See itertools.filterfalse() for the complementary function that returns elements of iterable for which function is false. class float ( number = 0.0 , / ) Â¶ class float ( string , / ) Return a floating-point number constructed from a number or a string. Examples: >>> float ( '+1.23' ) 1.23 >>> float ( ' -12345 \\n ' ) -12345.0 >>> float ( '1e-003' ) 0.001 >>> float ( '+1E6' ) 1000000.0 >>> float ( '-Infinity' ) -inf If the argument is a string, it should contain a decimal number, optionally preceded by a sign, and optionally embedded in whitespace. The optional sign may be '+' or '-' ; a '+' sign has no effect on the value produced. The argument may also be a string representing a NaN (not-a-number), or positive or negative infinity. More precisely, the input must conform to the floatvalue production rule in the following grammar, after leading and trailing whitespace characters are removed: sign : \"+\" | \"-\" infinity : \"Infinity\" | \"inf\" nan : \"nan\" digit : <a Unicode decimal digit, i.e. characters in Unicode general category Nd> digitpart : digit ([ \"_\" ] digit )* number : [ digitpart ] \".\" digitpart | digitpart [ \".\" ] exponent : ( \"e\" | \"E\" ) [ sign ] digitpart floatnumber : number [ exponent ] absfloatvalue : floatnumber | infinity | nan floatvalue : [ sign ] absfloatvalue Case is not significant, so, for example, âinfâ, âInfâ, âINFINITYâ, and âiNfINityâ are all acceptable spellings for positive infinity. Otherwise, if the argument is an integer or a floating-point number, a floating-point number with the same value (within Pythonâs floating-point precision) is returned. If the argument is outside the range of a Python float, an OverflowError will be raised. For a general Python object x , float(x) delegates to x.__float__() . If __float__() is not defined then it falls back to __index__() . See also float.from_number() which only accepts a numeric argument. If no argument is given, 0.0 is returned. The float type is described in Numeric Types â int, float, complex . Changed in version 3.6: Grouping digits with underscores as in code literals is allowed. Changed in version 3.7: The parameter is now positional-only. Changed in version 3.8: Falls back to __index__() if __float__() is not defined. format ( value , format_spec = '' , / ) Â¶ Convert a value to a âformattedâ representation, as controlled by format_spec . The interpretation of format_spec will depend on the type of the value argument; however, there is a standard formatting syntax that is used by most built-in types: Format Specification Mini-Language . The default format_spec is an empty string which usually gives the same effect as calling str(value) . A call to format(value, format_spec) is translated to type(value).__format__(value, format_spec) which bypasses the instance dictionary when searching for the valueâs __format__() method. A TypeError exception is raised if the method search reaches object and the format_spec is non-empty, or if either the format_spec or the return value are not strings. Changed in version 3.4: object().__format__(format_spec) raises TypeError if format_spec is not an empty string. class frozenset ( iterable = () , / ) Return a new frozenset object, optionally with elements taken from iterable . frozenset is a built-in class. See frozenset and Set Types â set, frozenset for documentation about this class. For other containers see the built-in set , list , tuple , and dict classes, as well as the collections module. getattr ( object , name , / ) Â¶ getattr ( object , name , default , / ) Return the value of the named attribute of object . name must be a string. If the string is the name of one of the objectâs attributes, the result is the value of that attribute. For example, getattr(x, 'foobar') is equivalent to x.foobar . If the named attribute does not exist, default is returned if provided, otherwise AttributeError is raised. name need not be a Python identifier (see setattr() ). Note Since private name mangling happens at compilation time, one must manually mangle a private attributeâs (attributes with two leading underscores) name in order to retrieve it with getattr() . globals ( ) Â¶ Return the dictionary implementing the current module namespace. For code within functions, this is set when the function is defined and remains the same regardless of where the function is called. hasattr ( object , name , / ) Â¶ The arguments are an object and a string. The result is True if the string is the name of one of the objectâs attributes, False if not. (This is implemented by calling getattr(object, name) and seeing whether it raises an AttributeError or not.) hash ( object , / ) Â¶ Return the hash value of the object (if it has one). Hash values are integers. They are used to quickly compare dictionary keys during a dictionary lookup. Numeric values that compare equal have the same hash value (even if they are of different types, as is the case for 1 and 1.0). Note For objects with custom __hash__() methods, note that hash() truncates the return value based on the bit width of the host machine. help ( ) Â¶ help ( request ) Invoke the built-in help system. (This function is intended for interactive use.) If no argument is given, the interactive help system starts on the interpreter console. If the argument is a string, then the string is looked up as the name of a module, function, class, method, keyword, or documentation topic, and a help page is printed on the console. If the argument is any other kind of object, a help page on the object is generated. Note that if a slash(/) appears in the parameter list of a function when invoking help() , it means that the parameters prior to the slash are positional-only. For more info, see the FAQ entry on positional-only parameters . This function is added to the built-in namespace by the site module. Changed in version 3.4: Changes to pydoc and inspect mean that the reported signatures for callables are now more comprehensive and consistent. hex ( integer , / ) Â¶ Convert an integer number to a lowercase hexadecimal string prefixed with â0xâ. If integer is not a Python int object, it has to define an __index__() method that returns an integer. Some examples: >>> hex ( 255 ) '0xff' >>> hex ( - 42 ) '-0x2a' If you want to convert an integer number to an uppercase or lower hexadecimal string with prefix or not, you can use either of the following ways: >>> ' %#x ' % 255 , ' %x ' % 255 , ' %X ' % 255 ('0xff', 'ff', 'FF') >>> format ( 255 , '#x' ), format ( 255 , 'x' ), format ( 255 , 'X' ) ('0xff', 'ff', 'FF') >>> f ' { 255 : #x } ' , f ' { 255 : x } ' , f ' { 255 : X } ' ('0xff', 'ff', 'FF') See also format() for more information. See also int() for converting a hexadecimal string to an integer using a base of 16. Note To obtain a hexadecimal string representation for a float, use the float.hex() method. id ( object , / ) Â¶ Return the âidentityâ of an object. This is an integer which is guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime. Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same id() value. CPython implementation detail: This is the address of the object in memory. Raises an auditing event builtins.id with argument id . input ( ) Â¶ input ( prompt , / ) If the prompt argument is present, it is written to standard output without a trailing newline. The function then reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that. When EOF is read, EOFError is raised. Example: >>> s = input ( '--> ' ) --> Monty Python's Flying Circus >>> s \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" If the readline module was loaded, then input() will use it to provide elaborate line editing and history features. Raises an auditing event builtins.input with argument prompt before reading input Raises an auditing event builtins.input/result with the result after successfully reading input. class int ( number = 0 , / ) Â¶ class int ( string , / , base = 10 ) Return an integer object constructed from a number or a string, or return 0 if no arguments are given. Examples: >>> int ( 123.45 ) 123 >>> int ( '123' ) 123 >>> int ( ' -12_345 \\n ' ) -12345 >>> int ( 'FACE' , 16 ) 64206 >>> int ( '0xface' , 0 ) 64206 >>> int ( '01110011' , base = 2 ) 115 If the argument defines __int__() , int(x) returns x.__int__() . If the argument defines __index__() , it returns x.__index__() . For floating-point numbers, this truncates towards zero. If the argument is not a number or if base is given, then it must be a string, bytes , or bytearray instance representing an integer in radix base . Optionally, the string can be preceded by + or - (with no space in between), have leading zeros, be surrounded by whitespace, and have single underscores interspersed between digits. A base-n integer string contains digits, each representing a value from 0 to n-1. The values 0â9 can be represented by any Unicode decimal digit. The values 10â35 can be represented by a to z (or A to Z ). The default base is 10. The allowed bases are 0 and 2â36. Base-2, -8, and -16 strings can be optionally prefixed with 0b / 0B , 0o / 0O , or 0x / 0X , as with integer literals in code. For base 0, the string is interpreted in a similar way to an integer literal in code , in that the actual base is 2, 8, 10, or 16 as determined by the prefix. Base 0 also disallows leading zeros: int('010', 0) is not legal, while int('010') and int('010', 8) are. The integer type is described in Numeric Types â int, float, complex . Changed in version 3.4: If base is not an instance of int and the base object has a base.__index__ method, that method is called to obtain an integer for the base. Previous versions used base.__int__ instead of base.__index__ . Changed in version 3.6: Grouping digits with underscores as in code literals is allowed. Changed in version 3.7: The first parameter is now positional-only. Changed in version 3.8: Falls back to __index__() if __int__() is not defined. Changed in version 3.11: int string inputs and string representations can be limited to help avoid denial of service attacks. A ValueError is raised when the limit is exceeded while converting a string to an int or when converting an int into a string would exceed the limit. See the integer string conversion length limitation documentation. Changed in version 3.14: int() no longer delegates to the __trunc__() method. isinstance ( object , classinfo , / ) Â¶ Return True if the object argument is an instance of the classinfo argument, or of a (direct, indirect, or virtual ) subclass thereof. If object is not an object of the given type, the function always returns False . If classinfo is a tuple of type objects (or recursively, other such tuples) or a Union Type of multiple types, return True if object is an instance of any of the types. If classinfo is not a type or tuple of types and such tuples, a TypeError exception is raised. TypeError may not be raised for an invalid type if an earlier check succeeds. Changed in version 3.10: classinfo can be a Union Type . issubclass ( class , classinfo , / ) Â¶ Return True if class is a subclass (direct, indirect, or virtual ) of classinfo . A class is considered a subclass of itself. classinfo may be a tuple of class objects (or recursively, other such tuples) or a Union Type , in which case return True if class is a subclass of any entry in classinfo . In any other case, a TypeError exception is raised. Changed in version 3.10: classinfo can be a Union Type . iter ( iterable , / ) Â¶ iter ( callable , sentinel , / ) Return an iterator object. The first argument is interpreted very differently depending on the presence of the second argument. Without a second argument, the single argument must be a collection object which supports the iterable protocol (the __iter__() method), or it must support the sequence protocol (the __getitem__() method with integer arguments starting at 0 ). If it does not support either of those protocols, TypeError is raised. If the second argument, sentinel , is given, then the first argument must be a callable object. The iterator created in this case will call callable with no arguments for each call to its __next__() method; if the value returned is equal to sentinel , StopIteration will be raised, otherwise the value will be returned. See also Iterator Types . One useful application of the second form of iter() is to build a block-reader. For example, reading fixed-width blocks from a binary database file until the end of file is reached: from functools import partial with open ( 'mydata.db' , 'rb' ) as f : for block in iter ( partial ( f . read , 64 ), b '' ): process_block ( block ) len ( object , / ) Â¶ Return the length (the number of items) of an object. The argument may be a sequence (such as a string, bytes, tuple, list, or range) or a collection (such as a dictionary, set, or frozen set). CPython implementation detail: len raises OverflowError on lengths larger than sys.maxsize , such as range(2 ** 100) . class list ( iterable = () , / ) Rather than being a function, list is actually a mutable sequence type, as documented in Lists and Sequence Types â list, tuple, range . locals ( ) Â¶ Return a mapping object representing the current local symbol table, with variable names as the keys, and their currently bound references as the values. At module scope, as well as when using exec() or eval() with a single namespace, this function returns the same namespace as globals() . At class scope, it returns the namespace that will be passed to the metaclass constructor. When using exec() or eval() with separate local and global arguments, it returns the local namespace passed in to the function call. In all of the above cases, each call to locals() in a given frame of execution will return the same mapping object. Changes made through the mapping object returned from locals() will be visible as assigned, reassigned, or deleted local variables, and assigning, reassigning, or deleting local variables will immediately affect the contents of the returned mapping object. In an optimized scope (including functions, generators, and coroutines), each call to locals() instead returns a fresh dictionary containing the current bindings of the functionâs local variables and any nonlocal cell references. In this case, name binding changes made via the returned dict are not written back to the corresponding local variables or nonlocal cell references, and assigning, reassigning, or deleting local variables and nonlocal cell references does not affect the contents of previously returned dictionaries. Calling locals() as part of a comprehension in a function, generator, or coroutine is equivalent to calling it in the containing scope, except that the comprehensionâs initialised iteration variables will be included. In other scopes, it behaves as if the comprehension were running as a nested function. Calling locals() as part of a generator expression is equivalent to calling it in a nested generator function. Changed in version 3.12: The behaviour of locals() in a comprehension has been updated as described in PEP 709 . Changed in version 3.13: As part of PEP 667 , the semantics of mutating the mapping objects returned from this function are now defined. The behavior in optimized scopes is now as described above. Aside from being defined, the behaviour in other scopes remains unchanged from previous versions. map ( function , iterable , / , * iterables , strict = False ) Â¶ Return an iterator that applies function to every item of iterable , yielding the results. If additional iterables arguments are passed, function must take that many arguments and is applied to the items from all iterables in parallel. With multiple iterables, the iterator stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted. If strict is True and one of the iterables is exhausted before the others, a ValueError is raised. For cases where the function inputs are already arranged into argument tuples, see itertools.starmap() . Changed in version 3.14: Added the strict parameter. max ( iterable , / , * , key = None ) Â¶ max ( iterable , / , * , default , key = None ) max ( arg1 , arg2 , / , * args , key = None ) Return the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments. If one positional argument is provided, it should be an iterable . The largest item in the iterable is returned. If two or more positional arguments are provided, the largest of the positional arguments is returned. There are two optional keyword-only arguments. The key argument specifies a one-argument ordering function like that used for list.sort() . The default argument specifies an object to return if the provided iterable is empty. If the iterable is empty and default is not provided, a ValueError is raised. If multiple items are maximal, the function returns the first one encountered. This is consistent with other sort-stability preserving tools such as sorted(iterable, key=keyfunc, reverse=True)[0] and heapq.nlargest(1, iterable, key=keyfunc) . Changed in version 3.4: Added the default keyword-only parameter. Changed in version 3.8: The key can be None . class memoryview ( object ) Return a âmemory viewâ object created from the given argument. See Memory Views for more information. min ( iterable , / , * , key = None ) Â¶ min ( iterable , / , * , default , key = None ) min ( arg1 , arg2 , / , * args , key = None ) Return the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments. If one positional argument is provided, it should be an iterable . The smallest item in the iterable is returned. If two or more positional arguments are provided, the smallest of the positional arguments is returned. There are two optional keyword-only arguments. The key argument specifies a one-argument ordering function like that used for list.sort() . The default argument specifies an object to return if the provided iterable is empty. If the iterable is empty and default is not provided, a ValueError is raised. If multiple items are minimal, the function returns the first one encountered. This is consistent with other sort-stability preserving tools such as sorted(iterable, key=keyfunc)[0] and heapq.nsmallest(1, iterable, key=keyfunc) . Changed in version 3.4: Added the default keyword-only parameter. Changed in version 3.8: The key can be None . next ( iterator , / ) Â¶ next ( iterator , default , / ) Retrieve the next item from the iterator by calling its __next__() method. If default is given, it is returned if the iterator is exhausted, otherwise StopIteration is raised. class object Â¶ This is the ultimate base class of all other classes. It has methods that are common to all instances of Python classes. When the constructor is called, it returns a new featureless object. The constructor does not accept any arguments. Note object instances do not have __dict__ attributes, so you canât assign arbitrary attributes to an instance of object . oct ( integer , / ) Â¶ Convert an integer number to an octal string prefixed with â0oâ. The result is a valid Python expression. If integer is not a Python int object, it has to define an __index__() method that returns an integer. For example: >>> oct ( 8 ) '0o10' >>> oct ( - 56 ) '-0o70' If you want to convert an integer number to an octal string either with the prefix â0oâ or not, you can use either of the following ways. >>> ' %#o ' % 10 , ' %o ' % 10 ('0o12', '12') >>> format ( 10 , '#o' ), format ( 10 , 'o' ) ('0o12', '12') >>> f ' { 10 : #o } ' , f ' { 10 : o } ' ('0o12', '12') See also format() for more information. open ( file , mode = 'r' , buffering = -1 , encoding = None , errors = None , newline = None , closefd = True , opener = None ) Â¶ Open file and return a corresponding file object . If the file cannot be opened, an OSError is raised. See Reading and Writing Files for more examples of how to use this function. file is a path-like object giving the pathname (absolute or relative to the current working directory) of the file to be opened or an integer file descriptor of the file to be wrapped. (If a file descriptor is given, it is closed when the returned I/O object is closed unless closefd is set to False .) mode is an optional string that specifies the mode in which the file is opened. It defaults to 'r' which means open for reading in text mode. Other common values are 'w' for writing (truncating the file if it already exists), 'x' for exclusive creation, and 'a' for appending (which on some Unix systems, means that all writes append to the end of the file regardless of the current seek position). In text mode, if encoding is not specified the encoding used is platform-dependent: locale.getencoding() is called to get the current locale encoding. (For reading and writing raw bytes use binary mode and leave encoding unspecified.) The available modes are: Character Meaning 'r' open for reading (default) 'w' open for writing, truncating the file first 'x' open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists 'a' open for writing, appending to the end of file if it exists 'b' binary mode 't' text mode (default) '+' open for updating (reading and writing) The default mode is 'r' (open for reading text, a synonym of 'rt' ). Modes 'w+' and 'w+b' open and truncate the file. Modes 'r+' and 'r+b' open the file with no truncation. As mentioned in the Overview , Python distinguishes between binary and text I/O. Files opened in binary mode (including 'b' in the mode argument) return contents as bytes objects without any decoding. In text mode (the default, or when 't' is included in the mode argument), the contents of the file are returned as str , the bytes having been first decoded using a platform-dependent encoding or using the specified encoding if given. Note Python doesnât depend on the underlying operating systemâs notion of text files; all the processing is done by Python itself, and is therefore platform-independent. buffering is an optional integer used to set the buffering policy. Pass 0 to switch buffering off (only allowed in binary mode), 1 to select line buffering (only usable when writing in text mode), and an integer > 1 to indicate the size in bytes of a fixed-size chunk buffer. Note that specifying a buffer size this way applies for binary buffered I/O, but TextIOWrapper (i.e., files opened with mode='r+' ) would have another buffering. To disable buffering in TextIOWrapper , consider using the write_through flag for io.TextIOWrapper.reconfigure() . When no buffering argument is given, the default buffering policy works as follows: Binary files are buffered in fixed-size chunks; the size of the buffer is max(min(blocksize, 8 MiB), DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE) when the device block size is available. On most systems, the buffer will typically be 128 kilobytes long. âInteractiveâ text files (files for which isatty() returns True ) use line buffering. Other text files use the policy described above for binary files. encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever locale.getencoding() returns), but any text encoding supported by Python can be used. See the codecs module for the list of supported encodings. errors is an optional string that specifies how encoding and decoding errors are to be handledâthis cannot be used in binary mode. A variety of standard error handlers are available (listed under Error Handlers ), though any error handling name that has been registered with codecs.register_error() is also valid. The standard names include: 'strict' to raise a ValueError exception if there is an encoding error. The default value of None has the same effect. 'ignore' ignores errors. Note that ignoring encoding errors can lead to data loss. 'replace' causes a replacement marker (such as '?' ) to be inserted where there is malformed data. 'surrogateescape' will represent any incorrect bytes as low surrogate code units ranging from U+DC80 to U+DCFF. These surrogate code units will then be turned back into the same bytes when the surrogateescape error handler is used when writing data. This is useful for processing files in an unknown encoding. 'xmlcharrefreplace' is only supported when writing to a file. Characters not supported by the encoding are replaced with the appropriate XML character reference &# nnn ; . 'backslashreplace' replaces malformed data by Pythonâs backslashed escape sequences. 'namereplace' (also only supported when writing) replaces unsupported characters with \\N{...} escape sequences. newline determines how to parse newline characters from the stream. It can be None , '' , '\\n' , '\\r' , and '\\r\\n' . It works as follows: When reading input from the stream, if newline is None , universal newlines mode is enabled. Lines in the input can end in '\\n' , '\\r' , or '\\r\\n' , and these are translated into '\\n' before being returned to the caller. If it is '' , universal newlines mode is enabled, but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated. If it has any of the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated. When writing output to the stream, if newline is None , any '\\n' characters written are translated to the system default line separator, os.linesep . If newline is '' or '\\n' , no translation takes place. If newline is any of the other legal values, any '\\n' characters written are translated to the given string. If closefd is False and a file descriptor rather than a filename was given, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open when the file is closed. If a filename is given closefd must be True (the default); otherwise, an error will be raised. A custom opener can be used by passing a callable as opener . The underlying file descriptor for the file object is then obtained by calling opener with ( file , flags ). opener must return an open file descriptor (passing os.open as opener results in functionality similar to passing None ). The newly created file is non-inheritable . The following example uses the dir_fd parameter of the os.open() function to open a file relative to a given directory: >>> import os >>> dir_fd = os . open ( 'somedir' , os . O_RDONLY ) >>> def opener ( path , flags ): ... return os . open ( path , flags , dir_fd = dir_fd ) ... >>> with open ( 'spamspam.txt' , 'w' , opener = opener ) as f : ... print ( 'This will be written to somedir/spamspam.txt' , file = f ) ... >>> os . close ( dir_fd ) # don't leak a file descriptor The type of file object returned by the open() function depends on the mode. When open() is used to open a file in a text mode ( 'w' , 'r' , 'wt' , 'rt' , etc.), it returns a subclass of io.TextIOBase (specifically io.TextIOWrapper ). When used to open a file in a binary mode with buffering, the returned class is a subclass of io.BufferedIOBase . The exact class varies: in read binary mode, it returns an io.BufferedReader ; in write binary and append binary modes, it returns an io.BufferedWriter , and in read/write mode, it returns an io.BufferedRandom . When buffering is disabled, the raw stream, a subclass of io.RawIOBase , io.FileIO , is returned. See also the file handling modules, such as fileinput , io (where open() is declared), os , os.path , tempfile , and shutil . Raises an auditing event open with arguments path , mode , flags . The mode and flags arguments may have been modified or inferred from the original call. Changed in version 3.3: The opener parameter was added. The 'x' mode was added. IOError used to be raised, it is now an alias of OSError . FileExistsError is now raised if the file opened in exclusive creation mode ( 'x' ) already exists. Changed in version 3.4: The file is now non-inheritable. Changed in version 3.5: If the system call is interrupted and the signal handler does not raise an exception, the function now retries the system call instead of raising an InterruptedError exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale). The 'namereplace' error handler was added. Changed in version 3.6: Support added to accept objects implementing os.PathLike . On Windows, opening a console buffer may return a subclass of io.RawIOBase other than io.FileIO . Changed in version 3.11: The 'U' mode has been removed. ord ( character , / ) Â¶ Return the ordinal value of a character. If the argument is a one-character string, return the Unicode code point of that character. For example, ord('a') returns the integer 97 and ord('â¬') (Euro sign) returns 8364 . This is the inverse of chr() . If the argument is a bytes or bytearray object of length 1, return its single byte value. For example, ord(b'a') returns the integer 97 . pow ( base , exp , mod = None ) Â¶ Return base to the power exp ; if mod is present, return base to the power exp , modulo mod (computed more efficiently than pow(base, exp) % mod ). The two-argument form pow(base, exp) is equivalent to using the power operator: base**exp . When arguments are builtin numeric types with mixed operand types, the coercion rules for binary arithmetic operators apply. For int operands, the result has the same type as the operands (after coercion) unless the second argument is negative; in that case, all arguments are converted to float and a float result is delivered. For example, pow(10, 2) returns 100 , but pow(10, -2) returns 0.01 . For a negative base of type int or float and a non-integral exponent, a complex result is delivered. For example, pow(-9, 0.5) returns a value close to 3j . Whereas, for a negative base of type int or float with an integral exponent, a float result is delivered. For example, pow(-9, 2.0) returns 81.0 . For int operands base and exp , if mod is present, mod must also be of integer type and mod must be nonzero. If mod is present and exp is negative, base must be relatively prime to mod . In that case, pow(inv_base, -exp, mod) is returned, where inv_base is an inverse to base modulo mod . Hereâs an example of computing an inverse for 38 modulo 97 : >>> pow ( 38 , - 1 , mod = 97 ) 23 >>> 23 * 38 % 97 == 1 True Changed in version 3.8: For int operands, the three-argument form of pow now allows the second argument to be negative, permitting computation of modular inverses. Changed in version 3.8: Allow keyword arguments. Formerly, only positional arguments were supported. print ( * objects , sep = ' ' , end = '\\n' , file = None , flush = False ) Â¶ Print objects to the text stream file , separated by sep and followed by end . sep , end , file , and flush , if present, must be given as keyword arguments. All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and written to the stream, separated by sep and followed by end . Both sep and end must be strings; they can also be None , which means to use the default values. If no objects are given, print() will just write end . The file argument must be an object with a write(string) method; if it is not present or None , sys.stdout will be used. Since printed arguments are converted to text strings, print() cannot be used with binary mode file objects. For these, use file.write(...) instead. Output buffering is usually determined by file . However, if flush is true, the stream is forcibly flushed. Changed in version 3.3: Added the flush keyword argument. class property ( fget = None , fset = None , fdel = None , doc = None ) Â¶ Return a property attribute. fget is a function for getting an attribute value. fset is a function for setting an attribute value. fdel is a function for deleting an attribute value. And doc creates a docstring for the attribute. A typical use is to define a managed attribute x : class C : def __init__ ( self ): self . _x = None def getx ( self ): return self . _x def setx ( self , value ): self . _x = value def delx ( self ): del self . _x x = property ( getx , setx , delx , \"I'm the 'x' property.\" ) If c is an instance of C , c.x will invoke the getter, c.x = value will invoke the setter, and del c.x the deleter. If given, doc will be the docstring of the property attribute. Otherwise, the property will copy fget âs docstring (if it exists). This makes it possible to create read-only properties easily using property() as a decorator : class Parrot : def __init__ ( self ): self . _voltage = 100000 @property def voltage ( self ): \"\"\"Get the current voltage.\"\"\" return self . _voltage The @property decorator turns the voltage() method into a âgetterâ for a read-only attribute with the same name, and it sets the docstring for voltage to âGet the current voltage.â @ getter Â¶ @ setter Â¶ @ deleter Â¶ A property object has getter , setter , and deleter methods usable as decorators that create a copy of the property with the corresponding accessor function set to the decorated function. This is best explained with an example: class C : def __init__ ( self ): self . _x = None @property def x ( self ): \"\"\"I'm the 'x' property.\"\"\" return self . _x @x . setter def x ( self , value ): self . _x = value @x . deleter def x ( self ): del self . _x This code is exactly equivalent to the first example. Be sure to give the additional functions the same name as the original property ( x in this case.) The returned property object also has the attributes fget , fset , and fdel corresponding to the constructor arguments. Changed in version 3.5: The docstrings of property objects are now writeable. __name__ Â¶ Attribute holding the name of the property. The name of the property can be changed at runtime. Added in version 3.13. class range ( stop , / ) class range ( start , stop , step = 1 , / ) Rather than being a function, range is actually an immutable sequence type, as documented in Ranges and Sequence Types â list, tuple, range . repr ( object , / ) Â¶ Return a string containing a printable representation of an object. For many types, this function makes an attempt to return a string that would yield an object with the same value when passed to eval() ; otherwise, the representation is a string enclosed in angle brackets that contains the name of the type of the object together with additional information often including the name and address of the object. A class can control what this function returns for its instances by defining a __repr__() method. If sys.displayhook() is not accessible, this function will raise RuntimeError . This class has a custom representation that can be evaluated: class Person : def __init__ ( self , name , age ): self . name = name self . age = age def __repr__ ( self ): return f \"Person(' { self . name } ', { self . age } )\" reversed ( object , / ) Â¶ Return a reverse iterator . The argument must be an object which has a __reversed__() method or supports the sequence protocol (the __len__() method and the __getitem__() method with integer arguments starting at 0 ). round ( number , ndigits = None ) Â¶ Return number rounded to ndigits precision after the decimal point. If ndigits is omitted or is None , it returns the nearest integer to its input. For the built-in types supporting round() , values are rounded to the closest multiple of 10 to the power minus ndigits ; if two multiples are equally close, rounding is done toward the even choice (so, for example, both round(0.5) and round(-0.5) are 0 , and round(1.5) is 2 ). Any integer value is valid for ndigits (positive, zero, or negative). The return value is an integer if ndigits is omitted or None . Otherwise, the return value has the same type as number . For a general Python object number , round delegates to number.__round__ . Note The behavior of round() for floats can be surprising: for example, round(2.675, 2) gives 2.67 instead of the expected 2.68 . This is not a bug: itâs a result of the fact that most decimal fractions canât be represented exactly as a float. See Floating-Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations for more information. class set ( iterable = () , / ) Return a new set object, optionally with elements taken from iterable . set is a built-in class. See set and Set Types â set, frozenset for documentation about this class. For other containers see the built-in frozenset , list , tuple , and dict classes, as well as the collections module. setattr ( object , name , value , / ) Â¶ This is the counterpart of getattr() . The arguments are an object, a string, and an arbitrary value. The string may name an existing attribute or a new attribute. The function assigns the value to the attribute, provided the object allows it. For example, setattr(x, 'foobar', 123) is equivalent to x.foobar = 123 . name need not be a Python identifier as defined in Names (identifiers and keywords) unless the object chooses to enforce that, for example in a custom __getattribute__() or via __slots__ . An attribute whose name is not an identifier will not be accessible using the dot notation, but is accessible through getattr() etc.. Note Since private name mangling happens at compilation time, one must manually mangle a private attributeâs (attributes with two leading underscores) name in order to set it with setattr() . class slice ( stop , / ) Â¶ class slice ( start , stop , step = None , / ) Return a slice object representing the set of indices specified by range(start, stop, step) . The start and step arguments default to None . Slice objects are also generated when slicing syntax is used. For example: a[start:stop:step] or a[start:stop, i] . See itertools.islice() for an alternate version that returns an iterator . start Â¶ stop Â¶ step Â¶ These read-only attributes are set to the argument values (or their default). They have no other explicit functionality; however, they are used by NumPy and other third-party packages. Changed in version 3.12: Slice objects are now hashable (provided start , stop , and step are hashable). sorted ( iterable , / , * , key = None , reverse = False ) Â¶ Return a new sorted list from the items in iterable . Has two optional arguments which must be specified as keyword arguments. key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each element in iterable (for example, key=str.lower ). The default value is None (compare the elements directly). reverse is a boolean value. If set to True , then the list elements are sorted as if each comparison were reversed. Use functools.cmp_to_key() to convert an old-style cmp function to a key function. The built-in sorted() function is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal â this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for example, sort by department, then by salary grade). The sort algorithm uses only < comparisons between items. While defining an __lt__() method will suffice for sorting, PEP 8 recommends that all six rich comparisons be implemented. This will help avoid bugs when using the same data with other ordering tools such as max() that rely on a different underlying method. Implementing all six comparisons also helps avoid confusion for mixed type comparisons which can call the reflected __gt__() method. For sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see Sorting Techniques . @ staticmethod Â¶ Transform a method into a static method. A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. To declare a static method, use this idiom: class C : @staticmethod def f ( arg1 , arg2 , argN ): ... The @staticmethod form is a function decorator â see Function definitions for details. A static method can be called either on the class (such as C.f() ) or on an instance (such as C().f() ). Moreover, the static method descriptor is also callable, so it can be used in the class definition (such as f() ). Static methods in Python are similar to those found in Java or C++. Also, see classmethod() for a variant that is useful for creating alternate class constructors. Like all decorators, it is also possible to call staticmethod as a regular function and do something with its result. This is needed in some cases where you need a reference to a function from a class body and you want to avoid the automatic transformation to instance method. For these cases, use this idiom: def regular_function (): ... class C : method = staticmethod ( regular_function ) For more information on static methods, see The standard type hierarchy . Changed in version 3.10: Static methods now inherit the method attributes ( __module__ , __name__ , __qualname__ , __doc__ and __annotations__ ), have a new __wrapped__ attribute, and are now callable as regular functions. class str ( * , encoding = 'utf-8' , errors = 'strict' ) class str ( object ) class str ( object , encoding , errors = 'strict' ) class str ( object , * , errors ) Return a str version of object . See str() for details. str is the built-in string class . For general information about strings, see Text Sequence Type â str . sum ( iterable , / , start = 0 ) Â¶ Sums start and the items of an iterable from left to right and returns the total. The iterable âs items are normally numbers, and the start value is not allowed to be a string. For some use cases, there are good alternatives to sum() . The preferred, fast way to concatenate a sequence of strings is by calling ''.join(sequence) . To add floating-point values with extended precision, see math.fsum() . To concatenate a series of iterables, consider using itertools.chain() . Changed in version 3.8: The start parameter can be specified as a keyword argument. Changed in version 3.12: Summation of floats switched to an algorithm that gives higher accuracy and better commutativity on most builds. Changed in version 3.14: Added specialization for summation of complexes, using same algorithm as for summation of floats. class super Â¶ class super ( type , object_or_type = None , / ) Return a proxy object that delegates method calls to a parent or sibling class of type . This is useful for accessing inherited methods that have been overridden in a class. The object_or_type determines the method resolution order to be searched. The search starts from the class right after the type . For example, if __mro__ of object_or_type is D -> B -> C -> A -> object and the value of type is B , then super() searches C -> A -> object . The __mro__ attribute of the class corresponding to object_or_type lists the method resolution search order used by both getattr() and super() . The attribute is dynamic and can change whenever the inheritance hierarchy is updated. If the second argument is omitted, the super object returned is unbound. If the second argument is an object, isinstance(obj, type) must be true. If the second argument is a type, issubclass(type2, type) must be true (this is useful for classmethods). When called directly within an ordinary method of a class, both arguments may be omitted (âzero-argument super() â). In this case, type will be the enclosing class, and obj will be the first argument of the immediately enclosing function (typically self ). (This means that zero-argument super() will not work as expected within nested functions, including generator expressions, which implicitly create nested functions.) There are two typical use cases for super . In a class hierarchy with single inheritance, super can be used to refer to parent classes without naming them explicitly, thus making the code more maintainable. This use closely parallels the use of super in other programming languages. The second use case is to support cooperative multiple inheritance in a dynamic execution environment. This use case is unique to Python and is not found in statically compiled languages or languages that only support single inheritance. This makes it possible to implement âdiamond diagramsâ where multiple base classes implement the same method. Good design dictates that such implementations have the same calling signature in every case (because the order of calls is determined at runtime, because that order adapts to changes in the class hierarchy, and because that order can include sibling classes that are unknown prior to runtime). For both use cases, a typical superclass call looks like this: class C ( B ): def method ( self , arg ): super () . method ( arg ) # This does the same thing as: # super(C, self).method(arg) In addition to method lookups, super() also works for attribute lookups. One possible use case for this is calling descriptors in a parent or sibling class. Note that super() is implemented as part of the binding process for explicit dotted attribute lookups such as super().__getitem__(name) . It does so by implementing its own __getattribute__() method for searching classes in a predictable order that supports cooperative multiple inheritance. Accordingly, super() is undefined for implicit lookups using statements or operators such as super()[name] . Also note that, aside from the zero argument form, super() is not limited to use inside methods. The two argument form specifies the arguments exactly and makes the appropriate references. The zero argument form only works inside a class definition, as the compiler fills in the necessary details to correctly retrieve the class being defined, as well as accessing the current instance for ordinary methods. For practical suggestions on how to design cooperative classes using super() , see guide to using super() . Changed in version 3.14: super objects are now pickleable and copyable . class tuple ( iterable = () , / ) Rather than being a function, tuple is actually an immutable sequence type, as documented in Tuples and Sequence Types â list, tuple, range . class type ( object , / ) Â¶ class type ( name , bases , dict , / , ** kwargs ) With one argument, return the type of an object . The return value is a type object and generally the same object as returned by object.__class__ . The isinstance() built-in function is recommended for testing the type of an object, because it takes subclasses into account. With three arguments, return a new type object. This is essentially a dynamic form of the class statement. The name string is the class name and becomes the __name__ attribute. The bases tuple contains the base classes and becomes the __bases__ attribute; if empty, object , the ultimate base of all classes, is added. The dict dictionary contains attribute and method definitions for the class body; it may be copied or wrapped before becoming the __dict__ attribute. The following two statements create identical type objects: >>> class X : ... a = 1 ... >>> X = type ( 'X' , (), dict ( a = 1 )) See also: Documentation on attributes and methods on classes . Type Objects Keyword arguments provided to the three argument form are passed to the appropriate metaclass machinery (usually __init_subclass__() ) in the same way that keywords in a class definition (besides metaclass ) would. See also Customizing class creation . Changed in version 3.6: Subclasses of type which donât override type.__new__ may no longer use the one-argument form to get the type of an object. vars ( ) Â¶ vars ( object , / ) Return the __dict__ attribute for a module, class, instance, or any other object with a __dict__ attribute. Objects such as modules and instances have an updateable __dict__ attribute; however, other objects may have write restrictions on their __dict__ attributes (for example, classes use a types.MappingProxyType to prevent direct dictionary updates). Without an argument, vars() acts like locals() . A TypeError exception is raised if an object is specified but it doesnât have a __dict__ attribute (for example, if its class defines the __slots__ attribute). Changed in version 3.13: The result of calling this function without an argument has been updated as described for the locals() builtin. zip ( * iterables , strict = False ) Â¶ Iterate over several iterables in parallel, producing tuples with an item from each one. Example: >>> for item in zip ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ], [ 'sugar' , 'spice' , 'everything nice' ]): ... print ( item ) ... (1, 'sugar') (2, 'spice') (3, 'everything nice') More formally: zip() returns an iterator of tuples, where the i -th tuple contains the i -th element from each of the argument iterables. Another way to think of zip() is that it turns rows into columns, and columns into rows. This is similar to transposing a matrix . zip() is lazy: The elements wonât be processed until the iterable is iterated on, e.g. by a for loop or by wrapping in a list . One thing to consider is that the iterables passed to zip() could have different lengths; sometimes by design, and sometimes because of a bug in the code that prepared these iterables. Python offers three different approaches to dealing with this issue: By default, zip() stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted. It will ignore the remaining items in the longer iterables, cutting off the result to the length of the shortest iterable: >>> list ( zip ( range ( 3 ), [ 'fee' , 'fi' , 'fo' , 'fum' ])) [(0, 'fee'), (1, 'fi'), (2, 'fo')] zip() is often used in cases where the iterables are assumed to be of equal length. In such cases, itâs recommended to use the strict=True option. Its output is the same as regular zip() : >>> list ( zip (( 'a' , 'b' , 'c' ), ( 1 , 2 , 3 ), strict = True )) [('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)] Unlike the default behavior, it raises a ValueError if one iterable is exhausted before the others: >>> for item in zip ( range ( 3 ), [ 'fee' , 'fi' , 'fo' , 'fum' ], strict = True ): ... print ( item ) ... (0, 'fee') (1, 'fi') (2, 'fo') Traceback (most recent call last): ... ValueError : zip() argument 2 is longer than argument 1 Without the strict=True argument, any bug that results in iterables of different lengths will be silenced, possibly manifesting as a hard-to-find bug in another part of the program. Shorter iterables can be padded with a constant value to make all the iterables have the same length. This is done by itertools.zip_longest() . Edge cases: With a single iterable argument, zip() returns an iterator of 1-tuples. With no arguments, it returns an empty iterator. Tips and tricks: The left-to-right evaluation order of the iterables is guaranteed. This makes possible an idiom for clustering a data series into n-length groups using zip(*[iter(s)]*n, strict=True) . This repeats the same iterator n times so that each output tuple has the result of n calls to the iterator. This has the effect of dividing the input into n-length chunks. zip() in conjunction with the * operator can be used to unzip a list: >>> x = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>> y = [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] >>> list ( zip ( x , y )) [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)] >>> x2 , y2 = zip ( * zip ( x , y )) >>> x == list ( x2 ) and y == list ( y2 ) True Changed in version 3.10: Added the strict argument. __import__ ( name , globals = None , locals = None , fromlist = () , level = 0 ) Â¶ Note This is an advanced function that is not needed in everyday Python programming, unlike importlib.import_module() . This function is invoked by the import statement. It can be replaced (by importing the builtins module and assigning to builtins.__import__ ) in order to change semantics of the import statement, but doing so is strongly discouraged as it is usually simpler to use import hooks (see PEP 302 ) to attain the same goals and does not cause issues with code which assumes the default import implementation is in use. Direct use of __import__() is also discouraged in favor of importlib.import_module() . The function imports the module name , potentially using the given globals and locals to determine how to interpret the name in a package context. The fromlist gives the names of objects or submodules that should be imported from the module given by name . The standard implementation does not use its locals argument at all and uses its globals only to determine the package context of the import statement. level specifies whether to use absolute or relative imports. 0 (the default) means only perform absolute imports. Positive values for level indicate the number of parent directories to search relative to the directory of the module calling __import__() (see PEP 328 for the details). When the name variable is of the form package.module , normally, the top-level package (the name up till the first dot) is returned, not the module named by name . However, when a non-empty fromlist argument is given, the module named by name is returned. For example, the statement import spam results in bytecode resembling the following code: spam = __import__ ( 'spam' , globals (), locals (), [], 0 ) The statement import spam.ham results in this call: spam = __import__ ( 'spam.ham' , globals (), locals (), [], 0 ) Note how __import__() returns the toplevel module here because this is the object that is bound to a name by the import statement. On the other hand, the statement from spam.ham import eggs, sausage as saus results in _temp = __import__ ( 'spam.ham' , globals (), locals (), [ 'eggs' , 'sausage' ], 0 ) eggs = _temp . eggs saus = _temp . sausage Here, the spam.ham module is returned from __import__() . From this object, the names to import are retrieved and assigned to their respective names. If you simply want to import a module (potentially within a package) by name, use importlib.import_module() . Changed in version 3.3: Negative values for level are no longer supported (which also changes the default value to 0). Changed in version 3.9: When the command line options -E or -I are being used, the environment variable PYTHONCASEOK is now ignored. Footnotes",

      "text_content": "Built-in Constants Â¶ A small number of constants live in the built-in namespace. They are: False Â¶ The false value of the bool type. Assignments to False are illegal and raise a SyntaxError . True Â¶ The true value of the bool type. Assignments to True are illegal and raise a SyntaxError . None Â¶ An object frequently used to represent the absence of a value, as when default arguments are not passed to a function. Assignments to None are illegal and raise a SyntaxError . None is the sole instance of the NoneType type. NotImplemented Â¶ A special value which should be returned by the binary special methods (e.g. __eq__() , __lt__() , __add__() , __rsub__() , etc.) to indicate that the operation is not implemented with respect to the other type; may be returned by the in-place binary special methods (e.g. __imul__() , __iand__() , etc.) for the same purpose. It should not be evaluated in a boolean context. NotImplemented is the sole instance of the types.NotImplementedType type. Note When a binary (or in-place) method returns NotImplemented the interpreter will try the reflected operation on the other type (or some other fallback, depending on the operator). If all attempts return NotImplemented , the interpreter will raise an appropriate exception. Incorrectly returning NotImplemented will result in a misleading error message or the NotImplemented value being returned to Python code. See Implementing the arithmetic operations for examples. Caution NotImplemented and NotImplementedError are not interchangeable. This constant should only be used as described above; see NotImplementedError for details on correct usage of the exception. Changed in version 3.9: Evaluating NotImplemented in a boolean context was deprecated. Changed in version 3.14: Evaluating NotImplemented in a boolean context now raises a TypeError . It previously evaluated to True and emitted a DeprecationWarning since Python 3.9. Ellipsis Â¶ The same as the ellipsis literal â ... â, an object frequently used to indicate that something is omitted. Assignment to Ellipsis is possible, but assignment to ... raises a SyntaxError . Ellipsis is the sole instance of the types.EllipsisType type. __debug__ Â¶ This constant is true if Python was not started with an -O option. See also the assert statement. Note The names None , False , True and __debug__ cannot be reassigned (assignments to them, even as an attribute name, raise SyntaxError ), so they can be considered âtrueâ constants. Constants added by the site module Â¶ The site module (which is imported automatically during startup, except if the -S command-line option is given) adds several constants to the built-in namespace. They are useful for the interactive interpreter shell and should not be used in programs. quit ( code = None ) Â¶ exit ( code = None ) Â¶ Objects that when printed, print a message like âUse quit() or Ctrl-D (i.e. EOF) to exitâ, and when accessed directly in the interactive interpreter or called as functions, raise SystemExit with the specified exit code. help Object that when printed, prints the message âType help() for interactive help, or help(object) for help about object.â, and when accessed directly in the interactive interpreter, invokes the built-in help system (see help() ). copyright Â¶ credits Â¶ Objects that when printed or called, print the text of copyright or credits, respectively. license Â¶ Object that when printed, prints the message âType license() to see the full license textâ, and when called, displays the full license text in a pager-like fashion (one screen at a time).",

      "text_content": "Built-in Types Â¶ The following sections describe the standard types that are built into the interpreter. The principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions. Some collection classes are mutable. The methods that add, subtract, or rearrange their members in place, and donât return a specific item, never return the collection instance itself but None . Some operations are supported by several object types; in particular, practically all objects can be compared for equality, tested for truth value, and converted to a string (with the repr() function or the slightly different str() function). The latter function is implicitly used when an object is written by the print() function. Truth Value Testing Â¶ Any object can be tested for truth value, for use in an if or while condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below. By default, an object is considered true unless its class defines either a __bool__() method that returns False or a __len__() method that returns zero, when called with the object. [ 1 ] If one of the methods raises an exception when called, the exception is propagated and the object does not have a truth value (for example, NotImplemented ). Here are most of the built-in objects considered false: constants defined to be false: None and False zero of any numeric type: 0 , 0.0 , 0j , Decimal(0) , Fraction(0, 1) empty sequences and collections: '' , () , [] , {} , set() , range(0) Operations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always return 0 or False for false and 1 or True for true, unless otherwise stated. (Important exception: the Boolean operations or and and always return one of their operands.) Boolean Operations â and , or , not Â¶ These are the Boolean operations, ordered by ascending priority: Operation Result Notes x or y if x is true, then x , else y (1) x and y if x is false, then x , else y (2) not x if x is false, then True , else False (3) Notes: This is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second argument if the first one is false. This is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second argument if the first one is true. not has a lower priority than non-Boolean operators, so not a == b is interpreted as not (a == b) , and a == not b is a syntax error. Comparisons Â¶ There are eight comparison operations in Python. They all have the same priority (which is higher than that of the Boolean operations). Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily; for example, x < y <= z is equivalent to x < y and y <= z , except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not evaluated at all when x < y is found to be false). This table summarizes the comparison operations: Operation Meaning < strictly less than <= less than or equal > strictly greater than >= greater than or equal == equal != not equal is object identity is not negated object identity Unless stated otherwise, objects of different types never compare equal. The == operator is always defined but for some object types (for example, class objects) is equivalent to is . The < , <= , > and >= operators are only defined where they make sense; for example, they raise a TypeError exception when one of the arguments is a complex number. Non-identical instances of a class normally compare as non-equal unless the class defines the __eq__() method. Instances of a class cannot be ordered with respect to other instances of the same class, or other types of object, unless the class defines enough of the methods __lt__() , __le__() , __gt__() , and __ge__() (in general, __lt__() and __eq__() are sufficient, if you want the conventional meanings of the comparison operators). The behavior of the is and is not operators cannot be customized; also they can be applied to any two objects and never raise an exception. Two more operations with the same syntactic priority, in and not in , are supported by types that are iterable or implement the __contains__() method. Numeric Types â int , float , complex Â¶ There are three distinct numeric types: integers , floating-point numbers , and complex numbers . In addition, Booleans are a subtype of integers. Integers have unlimited precision. Floating-point numbers are usually implemented using double in C; information about the precision and internal representation of floating-point numbers for the machine on which your program is running is available in sys.float_info . Complex numbers have a real and imaginary part, which are each a floating-point number. To extract these parts from a complex number z , use z.real and z.imag . (The standard library includes the additional numeric types fractions.Fraction , for rationals, and decimal.Decimal , for floating-point numbers with user-definable precision.) Numbers are created by numeric literals or as the result of built-in functions and operators. Unadorned integer literals (including hex, octal and binary numbers) yield integers. Numeric literals containing a decimal point or an exponent sign yield floating-point numbers. Appending 'j' or 'J' to a numeric literal yields an imaginary number (a complex number with a zero real part) which you can add to an integer or float to get a complex number with real and imaginary parts. The constructors int() , float() , and complex() can be used to produce numbers of a specific type. Python fully supports mixed arithmetic: when a binary arithmetic operator has operands of different numeric types, the operand with the ânarrowerâ type is widened to that of the other, where integer is narrower than floating point. Arithmetic with complex and real operands is defined by the usual mathematical formula, for example: x + complex ( u , v ) = complex ( x + u , v ) x * complex ( u , v ) = complex ( x * u , x * v ) A comparison between numbers of different types behaves as though the exact values of those numbers were being compared. [ 2 ] All numeric types (except complex) support the following operations (for priorities of the operations, see Operator precedence ): Operation Result Notes Full documentation x + y sum of x and y x - y difference of x and y x * y product of x and y x / y quotient of x and y x // y floored quotient of x and y (1)(2) x % y remainder of x / y (2) -x x negated +x x unchanged abs(x) absolute value or magnitude of x abs() int(x) x converted to integer (3)(6) int() float(x) x converted to floating point (4)(6) float() complex(re, im) a complex number with real part re , imaginary part im . im defaults to zero. (6) complex() c.conjugate() conjugate of the complex number c divmod(x, y) the pair (x // y, x % y) (2) divmod() pow(x, y) x to the power y (5) pow() x ** y x to the power y (5) Notes: Also referred to as integer division. For operands of type int , the result has type int . For operands of type float , the result has type float . In general, the result is a whole integer, though the resultâs type is not necessarily int . The result is always rounded towards minus infinity: 1//2 is 0 , (-1)//2 is -1 , 1//(-2) is -1 , and (-1)//(-2) is 0 . Not for complex numbers. Instead convert to floats using abs() if appropriate. Conversion from float to int truncates, discarding the fractional part. See functions math.floor() and math.ceil() for alternative conversions. float also accepts the strings ânanâ and âinfâ with an optional prefix â+â or â-â for Not a Number (NaN) and positive or negative infinity. Python defines pow(0, 0) and 0 ** 0 to be 1 , as is common for programming languages. The numeric literals accepted include the digits 0 to 9 or any Unicode equivalent (code points with the Nd property). See the Unicode Standard for a complete list of code points with the Nd property. All numbers.Real types ( int and float ) also include the following operations: Operation Result math.trunc(x) x truncated to Integral round(x[, n]) x rounded to n digits, rounding half to even. If n is omitted, it defaults to 0. math.floor(x) the greatest Integral <= x math.ceil(x) the least Integral >= x For additional numeric operations see the math and cmath modules. Bitwise Operations on Integer Types Â¶ Bitwise operations only make sense for integers. The result of bitwise operations is calculated as though carried out in twoâs complement with an infinite number of sign bits. The priorities of the binary bitwise operations are all lower than the numeric operations and higher than the comparisons; the unary operation ~ has the same priority as the other unary numeric operations ( + and - ). This table lists the bitwise operations sorted in ascending priority: Operation Result Notes x | y bitwise or of x and y (4) x ^ y bitwise exclusive or of x and y (4) x & y bitwise and of x and y (4) x << n x shifted left by n bits (1)(2) x >> n x shifted right by n bits (1)(3) ~x the bits of x inverted Notes: Negative shift counts are illegal and cause a ValueError to be raised. A left shift by n bits is equivalent to multiplication by pow(2, n) . A right shift by n bits is equivalent to floor division by pow(2, n) . Performing these calculations with at least one extra sign extension bit in a finite twoâs complement representation (a working bit-width of 1 + max(x.bit_length(), y.bit_length()) or more) is sufficient to get the same result as if there were an infinite number of sign bits. Additional Methods on Integer Types Â¶ The int type implements the numbers.Integral abstract base class . In addition, it provides a few more methods: int. bit_length ( ) Â¶ Return the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros: >>> n = - 37 >>> bin ( n ) '-0b100101' >>> n . bit_length () 6 More precisely, if x is nonzero, then x.bit_length() is the unique positive integer k such that 2**(k-1) <= abs(x) < 2**k . Equivalently, when abs(x) is small enough to have a correctly rounded logarithm, then k = 1 + int(log(abs(x), 2)) . If x is zero, then x.bit_length() returns 0 . Equivalent to: def bit_length ( self ): s = bin ( self ) # binary representation: bin(-37) --> '-0b100101' s = s . lstrip ( '-0b' ) # remove leading zeros and minus sign return len ( s ) # len('100101') --> 6 Added in version 3.1. int. bit_count ( ) Â¶ Return the number of ones in the binary representation of the absolute value of the integer. This is also known as the population count. Example: >>> n = 19 >>> bin ( n ) '0b10011' >>> n . bit_count () 3 >>> ( - n ) . bit_count () 3 Equivalent to: def bit_count ( self ): return bin ( self ) . count ( \"1\" ) Added in version 3.10. int. to_bytes ( length = 1 , byteorder = 'big' , * , signed = False ) Â¶ Return an array of bytes representing an integer. >>> ( 1024 ) . to_bytes ( 2 , byteorder = 'big' ) b'\\x04\\x00' >>> ( 1024 ) . to_bytes ( 10 , byteorder = 'big' ) b'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x04\\x00' >>> ( - 1024 ) . to_bytes ( 10 , byteorder = 'big' , signed = True ) b'\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xfc\\x00' >>> x = 1000 >>> x . to_bytes (( x . bit_length () + 7 ) // 8 , byteorder = 'little' ) b'\\xe8\\x03' The integer is represented using length bytes, and defaults to 1. An OverflowError is raised if the integer is not representable with the given number of bytes. The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the integer, and defaults to \"big\" . If byteorder is \"big\" , the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array. If byteorder is \"little\" , the most significant byte is at the end of the byte array. The signed argument determines whether twoâs complement is used to represent the integer. If signed is False and a negative integer is given, an OverflowError is raised. The default value for signed is False . The default values can be used to conveniently turn an integer into a single byte object: >>> ( 65 ) . to_bytes () b'A' However, when using the default arguments, donât try to convert a value greater than 255 or youâll get an OverflowError . Equivalent to: def to_bytes ( n , length = 1 , byteorder = 'big' , signed = False ): if byteorder == 'little' : order = range ( length ) elif byteorder == 'big' : order = reversed ( range ( length )) else : raise ValueError ( \"byteorder must be either 'little' or 'big'\" ) return bytes (( n >> i * 8 ) & 0xff for i in order ) Added in version 3.2. Changed in version 3.11: Added default argument values for length and byteorder . classmethod int. from_bytes ( bytes , byteorder = 'big' , * , signed = False ) Â¶ Return the integer represented by the given array of bytes. >>> int . from_bytes ( b ' \\x00\\x10 ' , byteorder = 'big' ) 16 >>> int . from_bytes ( b ' \\x00\\x10 ' , byteorder = 'little' ) 4096 >>> int . from_bytes ( b ' \\xfc\\x00 ' , byteorder = 'big' , signed = True ) -1024 >>> int . from_bytes ( b ' \\xfc\\x00 ' , byteorder = 'big' , signed = False ) 64512 >>> int . from_bytes ([ 255 , 0 , 0 ], byteorder = 'big' ) 16711680 The argument bytes must either be a bytes-like object or an iterable producing bytes. The byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the integer, and defaults to \"big\" . If byteorder is \"big\" , the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte array. If byteorder is \"little\" , the most significant byte is at the end of the byte array. To request the native byte order of the host system, use sys.byteorder as the byte order value. The signed argument indicates whether twoâs complement is used to represent the integer. Equivalent to: def from_bytes ( bytes , byteorder = 'big' , signed = False ): if byteorder == 'little' : little_ordered = list ( bytes ) elif byteorder == 'big' : little_ordered = list ( reversed ( bytes )) else : raise ValueError ( \"byteorder must be either 'little' or 'big'\" ) n = sum ( b << i * 8 for i , b in enumerate ( little_ordered )) if signed and little_ordered and ( little_ordered [ - 1 ] & 0x80 ): n -= 1 << 8 * len ( little_ordered ) return n Added in version 3.2. Changed in version 3.11: Added default argument value for byteorder . int. as_integer_ratio ( ) Â¶ Return a pair of integers whose ratio is equal to the original integer and has a positive denominator. The integer ratio of integers (whole numbers) is always the integer as the numerator and 1 as the denominator. Added in version 3.8. int. is_integer ( ) Â¶ Returns True . Exists for duck type compatibility with float.is_integer() . Added in version 3.12. Additional Methods on Float Â¶ The float type implements the numbers.Real abstract base class . float also has the following additional methods. classmethod float. from_number ( x ) Â¶ Class method to return a floating-point number constructed from a number x . If the argument is an integer or a floating-point number, a floating-point number with the same value (within Pythonâs floating-point precision) is returned. If the argument is outside the range of a Python float, an OverflowError will be raised. For a general Python object x , float.from_number(x) delegates to x.__float__() . If __float__() is not defined then it falls back to __index__() . Added in version 3.14. float. as_integer_ratio ( ) Â¶ Return a pair of integers whose ratio is exactly equal to the original float. The ratio is in lowest terms and has a positive denominator. Raises OverflowError on infinities and a ValueError on NaNs. float. is_integer ( ) Â¶ Return True if the float instance is finite with integral value, and False otherwise: >>> ( - 2.0 ) . is_integer () True >>> ( 3.2 ) . is_integer () False Two methods support conversion to and from hexadecimal strings. Since Pythonâs floats are stored internally as binary numbers, converting a float to or from a decimal string usually involves a small rounding error. In contrast, hexadecimal strings allow exact representation and specification of floating-point numbers. This can be useful when debugging, and in numerical work. float. hex ( ) Â¶ Return a representation of a floating-point number as a hexadecimal string. For finite floating-point numbers, this representation will always include a leading 0x and a trailing p and exponent. classmethod float. fromhex ( s ) Â¶ Class method to return the float represented by a hexadecimal string s . The string s may have leading and trailing whitespace. Note that float.hex() is an instance method, while float.fromhex() is a class method. A hexadecimal string takes the form: [ sign ] [ '0x' ] integer [ '.' fraction ] [ 'p' exponent ] where the optional sign may by either + or - , integer and fraction are strings of hexadecimal digits, and exponent is a decimal integer with an optional leading sign. Case is not significant, and there must be at least one hexadecimal digit in either the integer or the fraction. This syntax is similar to the syntax specified in section 6.4.4.2 of the C99 standard, and also to the syntax used in Java 1.5 onwards. In particular, the output of float.hex() is usable as a hexadecimal floating-point literal in C or Java code, and hexadecimal strings produced by Câs %a format character or Javaâs Double.toHexString are accepted by float.fromhex() . Note that the exponent is written in decimal rather than hexadecimal, and that it gives the power of 2 by which to multiply the coefficient. For example, the hexadecimal string 0x3.a7p10 represents the floating-point number (3 + 10./16 + 7./16**2) * 2.0**10 , or 3740.0 : >>> float . fromhex ( '0x3.a7p10' ) 3740.0 Applying the reverse conversion to 3740.0 gives a different hexadecimal string representing the same number: >>> float . hex ( 3740.0 ) '0x1.d380000000000p+11' Additional Methods on Complex Â¶ The complex type implements the numbers.Complex abstract base class . complex also has the following additional methods. classmethod complex. from_number ( x ) Â¶ Class method to convert a number to a complex number. For a general Python object x , complex.from_number(x) delegates to x.__complex__() . If __complex__() is not defined then it falls back to __float__() . If __float__() is not defined then it falls back to __index__() . Added in version 3.14. Hashing of numeric types Â¶ For numbers x and y , possibly of different types, itâs a requirement that hash(x) == hash(y) whenever x == y (see the __hash__() method documentation for more details). For ease of implementation and efficiency across a variety of numeric types (including int , float , decimal.Decimal and fractions.Fraction ) Pythonâs hash for numeric types is based on a single mathematical function thatâs defined for any rational number, and hence applies to all instances of int and fractions.Fraction , and all finite instances of float and decimal.Decimal . Essentially, this function is given by reduction modulo P for a fixed prime P . The value of P is made available to Python as the modulus attribute of sys.hash_info . CPython implementation detail: Currently, the prime used is P = 2**31 - 1 on machines with 32-bit C longs and P = 2**61 - 1 on machines with 64-bit C longs. Here are the rules in detail: If x = m / n is a nonnegative rational number and n is not divisible by P , define hash(x) as m * invmod(n, P) % P , where invmod(n, P) gives the inverse of n modulo P . If x = m / n is a nonnegative rational number and n is divisible by P (but m is not) then n has no inverse modulo P and the rule above doesnât apply; in this case define hash(x) to be the constant value sys.hash_info.inf . If x = m / n is a negative rational number define hash(x) as -hash(-x) . If the resulting hash is -1 , replace it with -2 . The particular values sys.hash_info.inf and -sys.hash_info.inf are used as hash values for positive infinity or negative infinity (respectively). For a complex number z , the hash values of the real and imaginary parts are combined by computing hash(z.real) + sys.hash_info.imag * hash(z.imag) , reduced modulo 2**sys.hash_info.width so that it lies in range(-2**(sys.hash_info.width - 1), 2**(sys.hash_info.width - 1)) . Again, if the result is -1 , itâs replaced with -2 . To clarify the above rules, hereâs some example Python code, equivalent to the built-in hash, for computing the hash of a rational number, float , or complex : import sys , math def hash_fraction ( m , n ): \"\"\"Compute the hash of a rational number m / n. Assumes m and n are integers, with n positive. Equivalent to hash(fractions.Fraction(m, n)). \"\"\" P = sys . hash_info . modulus # Remove common factors of P. (Unnecessary if m and n already coprime.) while m % P == n % P == 0 : m , n = m // P , n // P if n % P == 0 : hash_value = sys . hash_info . inf else : # Fermat's Little Theorem: pow(n, P-1, P) is 1, so # pow(n, P-2, P) gives the inverse of n modulo P. hash_value = ( abs ( m ) % P ) * pow ( n , P - 2 , P ) % P if m < 0 : hash_value = - hash_value if hash_value == - 1 : hash_value = - 2 return hash_value def hash_float ( x ): \"\"\"Compute the hash of a float x.\"\"\" if math . isnan ( x ): return object . __hash__ ( x ) elif math . isinf ( x ): return sys . hash_info . inf if x > 0 else - sys . hash_info . inf else : return hash_fraction ( * x . as_integer_ratio ()) def hash_complex ( z ): \"\"\"Compute the hash of a complex number z.\"\"\" hash_value = hash_float ( z . real ) + sys . hash_info . imag * hash_float ( z . imag ) # do a signed reduction modulo 2**sys.hash_info.width M = 2 ** ( sys . hash_info . width - 1 ) hash_value = ( hash_value & ( M - 1 )) - ( hash_value & M ) if hash_value == - 1 : hash_value = - 2 return hash_value Boolean Type - bool Â¶ Booleans represent truth values. The bool type has exactly two constant instances: True and False . The built-in function bool() converts any value to a boolean, if the value can be interpreted as a truth value (see section Truth Value Testing above). For logical operations, use the boolean operators and , or and not . When applying the bitwise operators & , | , ^ to two booleans, they return a bool equivalent to the logical operations âandâ, âorâ, âxorâ. However, the logical operators and , or and != should be preferred over & , | and ^ . Deprecated since version 3.12: The use of the bitwise inversion operator ~ is deprecated and will raise an error in Python 3.16. bool is a subclass of int (see Numeric Types â int, float, complex ). In many numeric contexts, False and True behave like the integers 0 and 1, respectively. However, relying on this is discouraged; explicitly convert using int() instead. Iterator Types Â¶ Python supports a concept of iteration over containers. This is implemented using two distinct methods; these are used to allow user-defined classes to support iteration. Sequences, described below in more detail, always support the iteration methods. One method needs to be defined for container objects to provide iterable support: container. __iter__ ( ) Â¶ Return an iterator object. The object is required to support the iterator protocol described below. If a container supports different types of iteration, additional methods can be provided to specifically request iterators for those iteration types. (An example of an object supporting multiple forms of iteration would be a tree structure which supports both breadth-first and depth-first traversal.) This method corresponds to the tp_iter slot of the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API. The iterator objects themselves are required to support the following two methods, which together form the iterator protocol : iterator. __iter__ ( ) Â¶ Return the iterator object itself. This is required to allow both containers and iterators to be used with the for and in statements. This method corresponds to the tp_iter slot of the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API. iterator. __next__ ( ) Â¶ Return the next item from the iterator . If there are no further items, raise the StopIteration exception. This method corresponds to the tp_iternext slot of the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API. Python defines several iterator objects to support iteration over general and specific sequence types, dictionaries, and other more specialized forms. The specific types are not important beyond their implementation of the iterator protocol. Once an iteratorâs __next__() method raises StopIteration , it must continue to do so on subsequent calls. Implementations that do not obey this property are deemed broken. Generator Types Â¶ Pythonâs generator s provide a convenient way to implement the iterator protocol. If a container objectâs __iter__() method is implemented as a generator, it will automatically return an iterator object (technically, a generator object) supplying the __iter__() and __next__() methods. More information about generators can be found in the documentation for the yield expression . Sequence Types â list , tuple , range Â¶ There are three basic sequence types: lists, tuples, and range objects. Additional sequence types tailored for processing of binary data and text strings are described in dedicated sections. Common Sequence Operations Â¶ The operations in the following table are supported by most sequence types, both mutable and immutable. The collections.abc.Sequence ABC is provided to make it easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence types. This table lists the sequence operations sorted in ascending priority. In the table, s and t are sequences of the same type, n , i , j and k are integers and x is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value restrictions imposed by s . The in and not in operations have the same priorities as the comparison operations. The + (concatenation) and * (repetition) operations have the same priority as the corresponding numeric operations. [ 3 ] Operation Result Notes x in s True if an item of s is equal to x , else False (1) x not in s False if an item of s is equal to x , else True (1) s + t the concatenation of s and t (6)(7) s * n or n * s equivalent to adding s to itself n times (2)(7) s[i] i th item of s , origin 0 (3)(8) s[i:j] slice of s from i to j (3)(4) s[i:j:k] slice of s from i to j with step k (3)(5) len(s) length of s min(s) smallest item of s max(s) largest item of s Sequences of the same type also support comparisons. In particular, tuples and lists are compared lexicographically by comparing corresponding elements. This means that to compare equal, every element must compare equal and the two sequences must be of the same type and have the same length. (For full details see Comparisons in the language reference.) Forward and reversed iterators over mutable sequences access values using an index. That index will continue to march forward (or backward) even if the underlying sequence is mutated. The iterator terminates only when an IndexError or a StopIteration is encountered (or when the index drops below zero). Notes: While the in and not in operations are used only for simple containment testing in the general case, some specialised sequences (such as str , bytes and bytearray ) also use them for subsequence testing: >>> \"gg\" in \"eggs\" True Values of n less than 0 are treated as 0 (which yields an empty sequence of the same type as s ). Note that items in the sequence s are not copied; they are referenced multiple times. This often haunts new Python programmers; consider: >>> lists = [[]] * 3 >>> lists [[], [], []] >>> lists [ 0 ] . append ( 3 ) >>> lists [[3], [3], [3]] What has happened is that [[]] is a one-element list containing an empty list, so all three elements of [[]] * 3 are references to this single empty list. Modifying any of the elements of lists modifies this single list. You can create a list of different lists this way: >>> lists = [[] for i in range ( 3 )] >>> lists [ 0 ] . append ( 3 ) >>> lists [ 1 ] . append ( 5 ) >>> lists [ 2 ] . append ( 7 ) >>> lists [[3], [5], [7]] Further explanation is available in the FAQ entry How do I create a multidimensional list? . If i or j is negative, the index is relative to the end of sequence s : len(s) + i or len(s) + j is substituted. But note that -0 is still 0 . The slice of s from i to j is defined as the sequence of items with index k such that i <= k < j . If i is omitted or None , use 0 . If j is omitted or None , use len(s) . If i or j is less than -len(s) , use 0 . If i or j is greater than len(s) , use len(s) . If i is greater than or equal to j , the slice is empty. The slice of s from i to j with step k is defined as the sequence of items with index x = i + n*k such that 0 <= n < (j-i)/k . In other words, the indices are i , i+k , i+2*k , i+3*k and so on, stopping when j is reached (but never including j ). When k is positive, i and j are reduced to len(s) if they are greater. When k is negative, i and j are reduced to len(s) - 1 if they are greater. If i or j are omitted or None , they become âendâ values (which end depends on the sign of k ). Note, k cannot be zero. If k is None , it is treated like 1 . Concatenating immutable sequences always results in a new object. This means that building up a sequence by repeated concatenation will have a quadratic runtime cost in the total sequence length. To get a linear runtime cost, you must switch to one of the alternatives below: if concatenating str objects, you can build a list and use str.join() at the end or else write to an io.StringIO instance and retrieve its value when complete if concatenating bytes objects, you can similarly use bytes.join() or io.BytesIO , or you can do in-place concatenation with a bytearray object. bytearray objects are mutable and have an efficient overallocation mechanism if concatenating tuple objects, extend a list instead for other types, investigate the relevant class documentation Some sequence types (such as range ) only support item sequences that follow specific patterns, and hence donât support sequence concatenation or repetition. An IndexError is raised if i is outside the sequence range. Sequence Methods Sequence types also support the following methods: sequence. count ( value , / ) Â¶ Return the total number of occurrences of value in sequence . sequence. index ( value[, start[, stop] ) Â¶ Return the index of the first occurrence of value in sequence . Raises ValueError if value is not found in sequence . The start or stop arguments allow for efficient searching of subsections of the sequence, beginning at start and ending at stop . This is roughly equivalent to start + sequence[start:stop].index(value) , only without copying any data. Caution Not all sequence types support passing the start and stop arguments. Immutable Sequence Types Â¶ The only operation that immutable sequence types generally implement that is not also implemented by mutable sequence types is support for the hash() built-in. This support allows immutable sequences, such as tuple instances, to be used as dict keys and stored in set and frozenset instances. Attempting to hash an immutable sequence that contains unhashable values will result in TypeError . Mutable Sequence Types Â¶ The operations in the following table are defined on mutable sequence types. The collections.abc.MutableSequence ABC is provided to make it easier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence types. In the table s is an instance of a mutable sequence type, t is any iterable object and x is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value restrictions imposed by s (for example, bytearray only accepts integers that meet the value restriction 0 <= x <= 255 ). Operation Result Notes s[i] = x item i of s is replaced by x del s[i] removes item i of s s[i:j] = t slice of s from i to j is replaced by the contents of the iterable t del s[i:j] removes the elements of s[i:j] from the list (same as s[i:j] = [] ) s[i:j:k] = t the elements of s[i:j:k] are replaced by those of t (1) del s[i:j:k] removes the elements of s[i:j:k] from the list s += t extends s with the contents of t (for the most part the same as s[len(s):len(s)] = t ) s *= n updates s with its contents repeated n times (2) Notes: If k is not equal to 1 , t must have the same length as the slice it is replacing. The value n is an integer, or an object implementing __index__() . Zero and negative values of n clear the sequence. Items in the sequence are not copied; they are referenced multiple times, as explained for s * n under Common Sequence Operations . Mutable Sequence Methods Mutable sequence types also support the following methods: sequence. append ( value , / ) Â¶ Append value to the end of the sequence This is equivalent to writing seq[len(seq):len(seq)] = [value] . sequence. clear ( ) Â¶ Added in version 3.3. Remove all items from sequence . This is equivalent to writing del sequence[:] . sequence. copy ( ) Â¶ Added in version 3.3. Create a shallow copy of sequence . This is equivalent to writing sequence[:] . Hint The copy() method is not part of the MutableSequence ABC , but most concrete mutable sequence types provide it. sequence. extend ( iterable , / ) Â¶ Extend sequence with the contents of iterable . For the most part, this is the same as writing seq[len(seq):len(seq)] = iterable . sequence. insert ( index , value , / ) Â¶ Insert value into sequence at the given index . This is equivalent to writing sequence[index:index] = [value] . sequence. pop ( index = -1 , / ) Â¶ Retrieve the item at index and also removes it from sequence . By default, the last item in sequence is removed and returned. sequence. remove ( value , / ) Â¶ Remove the first item from sequence where sequence[i] == value . Raises ValueError if value is not found in sequence . sequence. reverse ( ) Â¶ Reverse the items of sequence in place. This method maintains economy of space when reversing a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side-effect, it returns None . Lists Â¶ Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of homogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by application). class list ( iterable = () , / ) Â¶ Lists may be constructed in several ways: Using a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list: [] Using square brackets, separating items with commas: [a] , [a, b, c] Using a list comprehension: [x for x in iterable] Using the type constructor: list() or list(iterable) The constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the same order as iterable âs items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a list, a copy is made and returned, similar to iterable[:] . For example, list('abc') returns ['a', 'b', 'c'] and list( (1, 2, 3) ) returns [1, 2, 3] . If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list, [] . Many other operations also produce lists, including the sorted() built-in. Lists implement all of the common and mutable sequence operations. Lists also provide the following additional method: sort ( * , key = None , reverse = False ) Â¶ This method sorts the list in place, using only < comparisons between items. Exceptions are not suppressed - if any comparison operations fail, the entire sort operation will fail (and the list will likely be left in a partially modified state). sort() accepts two arguments that can only be passed by keyword ( keyword-only arguments ): key specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a comparison key from each list element (for example, key=str.lower ). The key corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and then used for the entire sorting process. The default value of None means that list items are sorted directly without calculating a separate key value. The functools.cmp_to_key() utility is available to convert a 2.x style cmp function to a key function. reverse is a boolean value. If set to True , then the list elements are sorted as if each comparison were reversed. This method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when sorting a large sequence. To remind users that it operates by side effect, it does not return the sorted sequence (use sorted() to explicitly request a new sorted list instance). The sort() method is guaranteed to be stable. A sort is stable if it guarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal â this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for example, sort by department, then by salary grade). For sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see Sorting Techniques . CPython implementation detail: While a list is being sorted, the effect of attempting to mutate, or even inspect, the list is undefined. The C implementation of Python makes the list appear empty for the duration, and raises ValueError if it can detect that the list has been mutated during a sort. Thread safety for list objects Reading a single element from a list is atomic : lst [ i ] # list.__getitem__ The following methods traverse the list and use atomic reads of each item to perform their function. That means that they may return results affected by concurrent modifications: item in lst lst . index ( item ) lst . count ( item ) All of the above operations avoid acquiring per-object locks . They do not block concurrent modifications. Other operations that hold a lock will not block these from observing intermediate states. All other operations from here on block using the per-object lock . Writing a single item via lst[i] = x is safe to call from multiple threads and will not corrupt the list. The following operations return new objects and appear atomic to other threads: lst1 + lst2 # concatenates two lists into a new list x * lst # repeats lst x times into a new list lst . copy () # returns a shallow copy of the list The following methods that only operate on a single element with no shifting required are atomic : lst . append ( x ) # append to the end of the list, no shifting required lst . pop () # pop element from the end of the list, no shifting required The clear() method is also atomic . Other threads cannot observe elements being removed. The sort() method is not atomic . Other threads cannot observe intermediate states during sorting, but the list appears empty for the duration of the sort. The following operations may allow lock-free operations to observe intermediate states since they modify multiple elements in place: lst . insert ( idx , item ) # shifts elements lst . pop ( idx ) # idx not at the end of the list, shifts elements lst *= x # copies elements in place The remove() method may allow concurrent modifications since element comparison may execute arbitrary Python code (via __eq__() ). extend() is safe to call from multiple threads. However, its guarantees depend on the iterable passed to it. If it is a list , a tuple , a set , a frozenset , a dict or a dictionary view object (but not their subclasses), the extend operation is safe from concurrent modifications to the iterable. Otherwise, an iterator is created which can be concurrently modified by another thread. The same applies to inplace concatenation of a list with other iterables when using lst += iterable . Similarly, assigning to a list slice with lst[i:j] = iterable is safe to call from multiple threads, but iterable is only locked when it is also a list (but not its subclasses). Operations that involve multiple accesses, as well as iteration, are never atomic. For example: # NOT atomic: read-modify-write lst [ i ] = lst [ i ] + 1 # NOT atomic: check-then-act if lst : item = lst . pop () # NOT thread-safe: iteration while modifying for item in lst : process ( item ) # another thread may modify lst Consider external synchronization when sharing list instances across threads. See Python support for free threading for more information. Tuples Â¶ Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the enumerate() built-in). Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of homogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a set or dict instance). class tuple ( iterable = () , / ) Â¶ Tuples may be constructed in a number of ways: Using a pair of parentheses to denote the empty tuple: () Using a trailing comma for a singleton tuple: a, or (a,) Separating items with commas: a, b, c or (a, b, c) Using the tuple() built-in: tuple() or tuple(iterable) The constructor builds a tuple whose items are the same and in the same order as iterable âs items. iterable may be either a sequence, a container that supports iteration, or an iterator object. If iterable is already a tuple, it is returned unchanged. For example, tuple('abc') returns ('a', 'b', 'c') and tuple( [1, 2, 3] ) returns (1, 2, 3) . If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty tuple, () . Note that it is actually the comma which makes a tuple, not the parentheses. The parentheses are optional, except in the empty tuple case, or when they are needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity. For example, f(a, b, c) is a function call with three arguments, while f((a, b, c)) is a function call with a 3-tuple as the sole argument. Tuples implement all of the common sequence operations. For heterogeneous collections of data where access by name is clearer than access by index, collections.namedtuple() may be a more appropriate choice than a simple tuple object. Ranges Â¶ The range type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops. class range ( stop , / ) Â¶ class range ( start , stop , step = 1 , / ) The arguments to the range constructor must be integers (either built-in int or any object that implements the __index__() special method). If the step argument is omitted, it defaults to 1 . If the start argument is omitted, it defaults to 0 . If step is zero, ValueError is raised. For a positive step , the contents of a range r are determined by the formula r[i] = start + step*i where i >= 0 and r[i] < stop . For a negative step , the contents of the range are still determined by the formula r[i] = start + step*i , but the constraints are i >= 0 and r[i] > stop . A range object will be empty if r[0] does not meet the value constraint. Ranges do support negative indices, but these are interpreted as indexing from the end of the sequence determined by the positive indices. Ranges containing absolute values larger than sys.maxsize are permitted but some features (such as len() ) may raise OverflowError . Range examples: >>> list ( range ( 10 )) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] >>> list ( range ( 1 , 11 )) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] >>> list ( range ( 0 , 30 , 5 )) [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25] >>> list ( range ( 0 , 10 , 3 )) [0, 3, 6, 9] >>> list ( range ( 0 , - 10 , - 1 )) [0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9] >>> list ( range ( 0 )) [] >>> list ( range ( 1 , 0 )) [] Ranges implement all of the common sequence operations except concatenation and repetition (due to the fact that range objects can only represent sequences that follow a strict pattern and repetition and concatenation will usually violate that pattern). start Â¶ The value of the start parameter (or 0 if the parameter was not supplied) stop Â¶ The value of the stop parameter step Â¶ The value of the step parameter (or 1 if the parameter was not supplied) The advantage of the range type over a regular list or tuple is that a range object will always take the same (small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it only stores the start , stop and step values, calculating individual items and subranges as needed). Range objects implement the collections.abc.Sequence ABC, and provide features such as containment tests, element index lookup, slicing and support for negative indices (see Sequence Types â list, tuple, range ): >>> r = range ( 0 , 20 , 2 ) >>> r range(0, 20, 2) >>> 11 in r False >>> 10 in r True >>> r . index ( 10 ) 5 >>> r [ 5 ] 10 >>> r [: 5 ] range(0, 10, 2) >>> r [ - 1 ] 18 Testing range objects for equality with == and != compares them as sequences. That is, two range objects are considered equal if they represent the same sequence of values. (Note that two range objects that compare equal might have different start , stop and step attributes, for example range(0) == range(2, 1, 3) or range(0, 3, 2) == range(0, 4, 2) .) Changed in version 3.2: Implement the Sequence ABC. Support slicing and negative indices. Test int objects for membership in constant time instead of iterating through all items. Changed in version 3.3: Define â==â and â!=â to compare range objects based on the sequence of values they define (instead of comparing based on object identity). Added the start , stop and step attributes. See also The linspace recipe shows how to implement a lazy version of range suitable for floating-point applications. Text and Binary Sequence Type Methods Summary Â¶ The following table summarizes the text and binary sequence types methods by category.

Strings are immutable sequences of Unicode code points. String literals are written in a variety of ways: Single quotes: 'allows embedded \"double\" quotes' Double quotes: \"allows embedded 'single' quotes\" Triple quoted: '''Three single quotes''' , \"\"\"Three double quotes\"\"\" Triple quoted strings may span multiple lines - all associated whitespace will be included in the string literal. String literals that are part of a single expression and have only whitespace between them will be implicitly converted to a single string literal. That is, (\"spam \" \"eggs\") == \"spam eggs\" . See String and Bytes literals for more about the various forms of string literal, including supported escape sequences , and the r (ârawâ) prefix that disables most escape sequence processing. Strings may also be created from other objects using the str constructor. Since there is no separate âcharacterâ type, indexing a string produces strings of length 1. That is, for a non-empty string s , s[0] == s[0:1] . There is also no mutable string type, but str.join() or io.StringIO can be used to efficiently construct strings from multiple fragments. Changed in version 3.3: For backwards compatibility with the Python 2 series, the u prefix is once again permitted on string literals. It has no effect on the meaning of string literals and cannot be combined with the r prefix. class str ( * , encoding = 'utf-8' , errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ class str ( object ) class str ( object , encoding , errors = 'strict' ) class str ( object , * , errors ) Return a string version of object . If object is not provided, returns the empty string. Otherwise, the behavior of str() depends on whether encoding or errors is given, as follows. If neither encoding nor errors is given, str(object) returns type(object).__str__(object) , which is the âinformalâ or nicely printable string representation of object . For string objects, this is the string itself. If object does not have a __str__() method, then str() falls back to returning repr(object) . If at least one of encoding or errors is given, object should be a bytes-like object (e.g. bytes or bytearray ). In this case, if object is a bytes (or bytearray ) object, then str(bytes, encoding, errors) is equivalent to bytes.decode(encoding, errors) . Otherwise, the bytes object underlying the buffer object is obtained before calling bytes.decode() . See Binary Sequence Types â bytes, bytearray, memoryview and Buffer Protocol for information on buffer objects. Passing a bytes object to str() without the encoding or errors arguments falls under the first case of returning the informal string representation (see also the -b command-line option to Python). For example: >>> str ( b 'Zoot!' ) \"b'Zoot!'\" For more information on the str class and its methods, see Text Sequence Type â str and the String Methods section below. To output formatted strings, see the f-strings and Format String Syntax sections. In addition, see the Text Processing Services section. String Methods Â¶ Strings implement all of the common sequence operations, along with the additional methods described below. Strings also support two styles of string formatting, one providing a large degree of flexibility and customization (see str.format() , Format String Syntax and Custom String Formatting ) and the other based on C printf style formatting that handles a narrower range of types and is slightly harder to use correctly, but is often faster for the cases it can handle ( printf-style String Formatting ). The Text Processing Services section of the standard library covers a number of other modules that provide various text related utilities (including regular expression support in the re module). str. capitalize ( ) Â¶ Return a copy of the string with its first character capitalized and the rest lowercased. Changed in version 3.8: The first character is now put into titlecase rather than uppercase. This means that characters like digraphs will only have their first letter capitalized, instead of the full character. str. casefold ( ) Â¶ Return a casefolded copy of the string. Casefolded strings may be used for caseless matching. Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it is intended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For example, the German lowercase letter 'Ã' is equivalent to \"ss\" . Since it is already lowercase, lower() would do nothing to 'Ã' ; casefold() converts it to \"ss\" . For example: >>> 'straÃe' . lower () 'straÃe' >>> 'straÃe' . casefold () 'strasse' The casefolding algorithm is described in section 3.13 âDefault Case Foldingâ of the Unicode Standard . Added in version 3.3. str. center ( width , fillchar = ' ' , / ) Â¶ Return centered in a string of length width . Padding is done using the specified fillchar (default is an ASCII space). The original string is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s) . For example: >>> 'Python' . center ( 10 ) ' Python ' >>> 'Python' . center ( 10 , '-' ) '--Python--' >>> 'Python' . center ( 4 ) 'Python' str. count ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in the range [ start , end ]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. If sub is empty, returns the number of empty strings between characters which is the length of the string plus one. For example: >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . count ( 'spam' ) 3 >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . count ( 'spam' , 5 ) 2 >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . count ( 'spam' , 5 , 10 ) 1 >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . count ( 'eggs' ) 0 >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . count ( '' ) 17 str. encode ( encoding = 'utf-8' , errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ Return the string encoded to bytes . encoding defaults to 'utf-8' ; see Standard Encodings for possible values. errors controls how encoding errors are handled. If 'strict' (the default), a UnicodeError exception is raised. Other possible values are 'ignore' , 'replace' , 'xmlcharrefreplace' , 'backslashreplace' and any other name registered via codecs.register_error() . See Error Handlers for details. For performance reasons, the value of errors is not checked for validity unless an encoding error actually occurs, Python Development Mode is enabled or a debug build is used. For example: >>> encoded_str_to_bytes = 'Python' . encode () >>> type ( encoded_str_to_bytes ) <class 'bytes'> >>> encoded_str_to_bytes b'Python' Changed in version 3.1: Added support for keyword arguments. Changed in version 3.9: The value of the errors argument is now checked in Python Development Mode and in debug mode . str. endswith ( suffix [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ Return True if the string ends with the specified suffix , otherwise return False . suffix can also be a tuple of suffixes to look for. With optional start , test beginning at that position. With optional end , stop comparing at that position. Using start and end is equivalent to str[start:end].endswith(suffix) . For example: >>> 'Python' . endswith ( 'on' ) True >>> 'a tuple of suffixes' . endswith (( 'at' , 'in' )) False >>> 'a tuple of suffixes' . endswith (( 'at' , 'es' )) True >>> 'Python is amazing' . endswith ( 'is' , 0 , 9 ) True See also startswith() and removesuffix() . str. expandtabs ( tabsize = 8 ) Â¶ Return a copy of the string where all tab characters are replaced by one or more spaces, depending on the current column and the given tab size. Tab positions occur every tabsize characters (default is 8, giving tab positions at columns 0, 8, 16 and so on). To expand the string, the current column is set to zero and the string is examined character by character. If the character is a tab ( \\t ), one or more space characters are inserted in the result until the current column is equal to the next tab position. (The tab character itself is not copied.) If the character is a newline ( \\n ) or return ( \\r ), it is copied and the current column is reset to zero. Any other character is copied unchanged and the current column is incremented by one regardless of how the character is represented when printed. For example: >>> '01 \\t 012 \\t 0123 \\t 01234' . expandtabs () '01 012 0123 01234' >>> '01 \\t 012 \\t 0123 \\t 01234' . expandtabs ( 4 ) '01 012 0123 01234' >>> print ( '01 \\t 012 \\n 0123 \\t 01234' . expandtabs ( 4 )) 01 012 0123 01234 str. find ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ Return the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found within the slice s[start:end] . Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Return -1 if sub is not found. For example: >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . find ( 'sp' ) 0 >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . find ( 'sp' , 5 ) 6 See also rfind() and index() . Note The find() method should be used only if you need to know the position of sub . To check if sub is a substring or not, use the in operator: >>> 'Py' in 'Python' True str. format ( * args , ** kwargs ) Â¶ Perform a string formatting operation. The string on which this method is called can contain literal text or replacement fields delimited by braces {} . Each replacement field contains either the numeric index of a positional argument, or the name of a keyword argument. Returns a copy of the string where each replacement field is replaced with the string value of the corresponding argument. For example: >>> \"The sum of 1 + 2 is {0} \" . format ( 1 + 2 ) 'The sum of 1 + 2 is 3' >>> \"The sum of {a} + {b} is {answer} \" . format ( answer = 1 + 2 , a = 1 , b = 2 ) 'The sum of 1 + 2 is 3' >>> \" {1} expects the {0} Inquisition!\" . format ( \"Spanish\" , \"Nobody\" ) 'Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!' See Format String Syntax for a description of the various formatting options that can be specified in format strings. Note When formatting a number ( int , float , complex , decimal.Decimal and subclasses) with the n type (ex: '{:n}'.format(1234) ), the function temporarily sets the LC_CTYPE locale to the LC_NUMERIC locale to decode decimal_point and thousands_sep fields of localeconv() if they are non-ASCII or longer than 1 byte, and the LC_NUMERIC locale is different than the LC_CTYPE locale. This temporary change affects other threads. Changed in version 3.7: When formatting a number with the n type, the function sets temporarily the LC_CTYPE locale to the LC_NUMERIC locale in some cases. str. format_map ( mapping , / ) Â¶ Similar to str.format(**mapping) , except that mapping is used directly and not copied to a dict . This is useful if for example mapping is a dict subclass: >>> class Default ( dict ): ... def __missing__ ( self , key ): ... return key ... >>> ' {name} was born in {country} ' . format_map ( Default ( name = 'Guido' )) 'Guido was born in country' Added in version 3.2. str. index ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ Like find() , but raise ValueError when the substring is not found. For example: >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . index ( 'spam' ) 0 >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . index ( 'eggs' ) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<python-input-0>\" , line 1 , in <module> 'spam, spam, spam' . index ( 'eggs' ) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^ ValueError : substring not found See also rindex() . str. isalnum ( ) Â¶ Return True if all characters in the string are alphanumeric and there is at least one character, False otherwise. A character c is alphanumeric if one of the following returns True : c.isalpha() , c.isdecimal() , c.isdigit() , or c.isnumeric() . For example: .. doctest :: >>> 'abc123' . isalnum () True >>> 'abc123!@#' . isalnum () False >>> '' . isalnum () False >>> ' ' . isalnum () False str. isalpha ( ) Â¶ Return True if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least one character, False otherwise. Alphabetic characters are those characters defined in the Unicode character database as âLetterâ, i.e., those with general category property being one of âLmâ, âLtâ, âLuâ, âLlâ, or âLoâ. Note that this is different from the Alphabetic property defined in the section 4.10 âLetters, Alphabetic, and Ideographicâ of the Unicode Standard . For example: >>> 'Letters and spaces' . isalpha () False >>> 'LettersOnly' . isalpha () True >>> 'Âµ' . isalpha () # non-ASCII characters can be considered alphabetical too True See Unicode Properties . str. isascii ( ) Â¶ Return True if the string is empty or all characters in the string are ASCII, False otherwise. ASCII characters have code points in the range U+0000-U+007F. For example: >>> 'ASCII characters' . isascii () True >>> 'Âµ' . isascii () False Added in version 3.7. str. isdecimal ( ) Â¶ Return True if all characters in the string are decimal characters and there is at least one character, False otherwise. Decimal characters are those that can be used to form numbers in base 10, such as U+0660, ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT ZERO. Formally a decimal character is a character in the Unicode General Category âNdâ. For example: >>> '0123456789' . isdecimal () True >>> 'Ù Ù¡Ù¢Ù£Ù¤Ù¥Ù¦Ù§Ù¨Ù©' . isdecimal () # Arabic-Indic digits zero to nine True >>> 'alphabetic' . isdecimal () False str. isdigit ( ) Â¶ Return True if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one character, False otherwise. Digits include decimal characters and digits that need special handling, such as the compatibility superscript digits. This covers digits which cannot be used to form numbers in base 10, like the Kharosthi numbers. Formally, a digit is a character that has the property value Numeric_Type=Digit or Numeric_Type=Decimal. str. isidentifier ( ) Â¶ Return True if the string is a valid identifier according to the language definition, section Names (identifiers and keywords) . keyword.iskeyword() can be used to test whether string s is a reserved identifier, such as def and class . Example: >>> from keyword import iskeyword >>> 'hello' . isidentifier (), iskeyword ( 'hello' ) (True, False) >>> 'def' . isidentifier (), iskeyword ( 'def' ) (True, True) str. islower ( ) Â¶ Return True if all cased characters [ 4 ] in the string are lowercase and there is at least one cased character, False otherwise. str. isnumeric ( ) Â¶ Return True if all characters in the string are numeric characters, and there is at least one character, False otherwise. Numeric characters include digit characters, and all characters that have the Unicode numeric value property, e.g. U+2155, VULGAR FRACTION ONE FIFTH. Formally, numeric characters are those with the property value Numeric_Type=Digit, Numeric_Type=Decimal or Numeric_Type=Numeric. For example: >>> '0123456789' . isnumeric () True >>> 'Ù Ù¡Ù¢Ù£Ù¤Ù¥Ù¦Ù§Ù¨Ù©' . isnumeric () # Arabic-indic digit zero to nine True >>> 'â ' . isnumeric () # Vulgar fraction one fifth True >>> 'Â²' . isdecimal (), 'Â²' . isdigit (), 'Â²' . isnumeric () (False, True, True) See also isdecimal() and isdigit() . Numeric characters are a superset of decimal numbers. str. isprintable ( ) Â¶ Return True if all characters in the string are printable, False if it contains at least one non-printable character. Here âprintableâ means the character is suitable for repr() to use in its output; ânon-printableâ means that repr() on built-in types will hex-escape the character. It has no bearing on the handling of strings written to sys.stdout or sys.stderr . The printable characters are those which in the Unicode character database (see unicodedata ) have a general category in group Letter, Mark, Number, Punctuation, or Symbol (L, M, N, P, or S); plus the ASCII space 0x20. Nonprintable characters are those in group Separator or Other (Z or C), except the ASCII space. For example: >>> '' . isprintable (), ' ' . isprintable () (True, True) >>> ' \\t ' . isprintable (), ' \\n ' . isprintable () (False, False) str. isspace ( ) Â¶ Return True if there are only whitespace characters in the string and there is at least one character, False otherwise. A character is whitespace if in the Unicode character database (see unicodedata ), either its general category is Zs (âSeparator, spaceâ), or its bidirectional class is one of WS , B , or S . str. istitle ( ) Â¶ Return True if the string is a titlecased string and there is at least one character, for example uppercase characters may only follow uncased characters and lowercase characters only cased ones. Return False otherwise. For example: >>> 'Spam, Spam, Spam' . istitle () True >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . istitle () False >>> 'SPAM, SPAM, SPAM' . istitle () False See also title() . str. isupper ( ) Â¶ Return True if all cased characters [ 4 ] in the string are uppercase and there is at least one cased character, False otherwise. >>> 'BANANA' . isupper () True >>> 'banana' . isupper () False >>> 'baNana' . isupper () False >>> ' ' . isupper () False str. join ( iterable , / ) Â¶ Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable . A TypeError will be raised if there are any non-string values in iterable , including bytes objects. The separator between elements is the string providing this method. For example: >>> ', ' . join ([ 'spam' , 'spam' , 'spam' ]) 'spam, spam, spam' >>> '-' . join ( 'Python' ) 'P-y-t-h-o-n' See also split() . str. ljust ( width , fillchar = ' ' , / ) Â¶ Return the string left justified in a string of length width . Padding is done using the specified fillchar (default is an ASCII space). The original string is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s) . For example: >>> 'Python' . ljust ( 10 ) 'Python ' >>> 'Python' . ljust ( 10 , '.' ) 'Python....' >>> 'Monty Python' . ljust ( 10 , '.' ) 'Monty Python' See also rjust() . str. lower ( ) Â¶ Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters [ 4 ] converted to lowercase. For example: >>> 'Lower Method Example' . lower () 'lower method example' The lowercasing algorithm used is described in section 3.13 âDefault Case Foldingâ of the Unicode Standard . str. lstrip ( chars = None , / ) Â¶ Return a copy of the string with leading characters removed. The chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed. If omitted or None , the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace. The chars argument is not a prefix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped: >>> ' spacious ' . lstrip () 'spacious ' >>> 'www.example.com' . lstrip ( 'cmowz.' ) 'example.com' See str.removeprefix() for a method that will remove a single prefix string rather than all of a set of characters. For example: >>> 'Arthur: three!' . lstrip ( 'Arthur: ' ) 'ee!' >>> 'Arthur: three!' . removeprefix ( 'Arthur: ' ) 'three!' static str. maketrans ( dict , / ) Â¶ static str. maketrans ( from , to , remove='' , / ) This static method returns a translation table usable for str.translate() . If there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping Unicode ordinals (integers) or characters (strings of length 1) to Unicode ordinals, strings (of arbitrary lengths) or None . Character keys will then be converted to ordinals. If there are two arguments, they must be strings of equal length, and in the resulting dictionary, each character in from will be mapped to the character at the same position in to . If there is a third argument, it must be a string, whose characters will be mapped to None in the result. str. partition ( sep , / ) Â¶ Split the string at the first occurrence of sep , and return a 3-tuple containing the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple containing the string itself, followed by two empty strings. For example: >>> 'Monty Python' . partition ( ' ' ) ('Monty', ' ', 'Python') >>> \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" . partition ( ' ' ) ('Monty', ' ', \"Python's Flying Circus\") >>> 'Monty Python' . partition ( '-' ) ('Monty Python', '', '') See also rpartition() . str. removeprefix ( prefix , / ) Â¶ If the string starts with the prefix string, return string[len(prefix):] . Otherwise, return a copy of the original string: >>> 'TestHook' . removeprefix ( 'Test' ) 'Hook' >>> 'BaseTestCase' . removeprefix ( 'Test' ) 'BaseTestCase' Added in version 3.9. See also removesuffix() and startswith() . str. removesuffix ( suffix , / ) Â¶ If the string ends with the suffix string and that suffix is not empty, return string[:-len(suffix)] . Otherwise, return a copy of the original string: >>> 'MiscTests' . removesuffix ( 'Tests' ) 'Misc' >>> 'TmpDirMixin' . removesuffix ( 'Tests' ) 'TmpDirMixin' Added in version 3.9. See also removeprefix() and endswith() . str. replace ( old , new , / , count = -1 ) Â¶ Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new . If count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced. If count is not specified or -1 , then all occurrences are replaced. For example: >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . replace ( 'spam' , 'eggs' ) 'eggs, eggs, eggs' >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . replace ( 'spam' , 'eggs' , 1 ) 'eggs, spam, spam' Changed in version 3.13: count is now supported as a keyword argument. str. rfind ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ Return the highest index in the string where substring sub is found, such that sub is contained within s[start:end] . Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Return -1 on failure. For example: >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . rfind ( 'sp' ) 12 >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . rfind ( 'sp' , 0 , 10 ) 6 See also find() and rindex() . str. rindex ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ Like rfind() but raises ValueError when the substring sub is not found. For example: >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . rindex ( 'spam' ) 12 >>> 'spam, spam, spam' . rindex ( 'eggs' ) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin-0>\" , line 1 , in <module> 'spam, spam, spam' . rindex ( 'eggs' ) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^ ValueError : substring not found See also index() and find() . str. rjust ( width , fillchar = ' ' , / ) Â¶ Return the string right justified in a string of length width . Padding is done using the specified fillchar (default is an ASCII space). The original string is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s) . str. rpartition ( sep , / ) Â¶ Split the string at the last occurrence of sep , and return a 3-tuple containing the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple containing two empty strings, followed by the string itself. For example: >>> 'Monty Python' . rpartition ( ' ' ) ('Monty', ' ', 'Python') >>> \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" . rpartition ( ' ' ) (\"Monty Python's Flying\", ' ', 'Circus') >>> 'Monty Python' . rpartition ( '-' ) ('', '', 'Monty Python') See also partition() . str. rsplit ( sep = None , maxsplit = -1 ) Â¶ Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string. If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are done, the rightmost ones. If sep is not specified or None , any whitespace string is a separator. Except for splitting from the right, rsplit() behaves like split() which is described in detail below. str. rstrip ( chars = None , / ) Â¶ Return a copy of the string with trailing characters removed. The chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed. If omitted or None , the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace. The chars argument is not a suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped. For example: >>> ' spacious ' . rstrip () ' spacious' >>> 'mississippi' . rstrip ( 'ipz' ) 'mississ' See removesuffix() for a method that will remove a single suffix string rather than all of a set of characters. For example: >>> 'Monty Python' . rstrip ( ' Python' ) 'M' >>> 'Monty Python' . removesuffix ( ' Python' ) 'Monty' See also strip() . str. split ( sep = None , maxsplit = -1 ) Â¶ Return a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string. If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are done (thus, the list will have at most maxsplit+1 elements). If maxsplit is not specified or -1 , then there is no limit on the number of splits (all possible splits are made). If sep is given, consecutive delimiters are not grouped together and are deemed to delimit empty strings (for example, '1,,2'.split(',') returns ['1', '', '2'] ). The sep argument may consist of multiple characters as a single delimiter (to split with multiple delimiters, use re.split() ). Splitting an empty string with a specified separator returns [''] . For example: >>> '1,2,3' . split ( ',' ) ['1', '2', '3'] >>> '1,2,3' . split ( ',' , maxsplit = 1 ) ['1', '2,3'] >>> '1,2,,3,' . split ( ',' ) ['1', '2', '', '3', ''] >>> '1<>2<>3<4' . split ( '<>' ) ['1', '2', '3<4'] If sep is not specified or is None , a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the string has leading or trailing whitespace. Consequently, splitting an empty string or a string consisting of just whitespace with a None separator returns [] . For example: >>> '1 2 3' . split () ['1', '2', '3'] >>> '1 2 3' . split ( maxsplit = 1 ) ['1', '2 3'] >>> ' 1 2 3 ' . split () ['1', '2', '3'] If sep is not specified or is None and maxsplit is 0 , only leading runs of consecutive whitespace are considered. For example: >>> \"\" . split ( None , 0 ) [] >>> \" \" . split ( None , 0 ) [] >>> \" foo \" . split ( maxsplit = 0 ) ['foo '] See also join() . str. splitlines ( keepends = False ) Â¶ Return a list of the lines in the string, breaking at line boundaries. Line breaks are not included in the resulting list unless keepends is given and true. This method splits on the following line boundaries. In particular, the boundaries are a superset of universal newlines . Representation Description \\n Line Feed \\r Carriage Return \\r\\n Carriage Return + Line Feed \\v or \\x0b Line Tabulation \\f or \\x0c Form Feed \\x1c File Separator \\x1d Group Separator \\x1e Record Separator \\x85 Next Line (C1 Control Code) \\u2028 Line Separator \\u2029 Paragraph Separator Changed in version 3.2: \\v and \\f added to list of line boundaries. For example: >>> 'ab c \\n\\n de fg \\r kl \\r\\n ' . splitlines () ['ab c', '', 'de fg', 'kl'] >>> 'ab c \\n\\n de fg \\r kl \\r\\n ' . splitlines ( keepends = True ) ['ab c\\n', '\\n', 'de fg\\r', 'kl\\r\\n'] Unlike split() when a delimiter string sep is given, this method returns an empty list for the empty string, and a terminal line break does not result in an extra line: >>> \"\" . splitlines () [] >>> \"One line \\n \" . splitlines () ['One line'] For comparison, split('\\n') gives: >>> '' . split ( ' \\n ' ) [''] >>> 'Two lines \\n ' . split ( ' \\n ' ) ['Two lines', ''] str. startswith ( prefix [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ Return True if string starts with the prefix , otherwise return False . prefix can also be a tuple of prefixes to look for. With optional start , test string beginning at that position. With optional end , stop comparing string at that position. For example: >>> 'Python' . startswith ( 'Py' ) True >>> 'a tuple of prefixes' . startswith (( 'at' , 'a' )) True >>> 'Python is amazing' . startswith ( 'is' , 7 ) True See also endswith() and removeprefix() . str. strip ( chars = None , / ) Â¶ Return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed. The chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed. If omitted or None , the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace. The chars argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped. For example: >>> ' spacious ' . strip () 'spacious' >>> 'www.example.com' . strip ( 'cmowz.' ) 'example' The outermost leading and trailing chars argument values are stripped from the string. Characters are removed from the leading end until reaching a string character that is not contained in the set of characters in chars . A similar action takes place on the trailing end. For example: >>> comment_string = '#....... Section 3.2.1 Issue #32 .......' >>> comment_string . strip ( '.#! ' ) 'Section 3.2.1 Issue #32' See also rstrip() . str. swapcase ( ) Â¶ Return a copy of the string with uppercase characters converted to lowercase and vice versa. Note that it is not necessarily true that s.swapcase().swapcase() == s . str. title ( ) Â¶ Return a titlecased version of the string where words start with an uppercase character and the remaining characters are lowercase. For example: >>> 'Hello world' . title () 'Hello World' The algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a word as groups of consecutive letters. The definition works in many contexts but it means that apostrophes in contractions and possessives form word boundaries, which may not be the desired result: >>> \"they're bill's friends from the UK\" . title () \"They'Re Bill'S Friends From The Uk\" The string.capwords() function does not have this problem, as it splits words on spaces only. Alternatively, a workaround for apostrophes can be constructed using regular expressions: >>> import re >>> def titlecase ( s ): ... return re . sub ( r \"[A-Za-z]+('[A-Za-z]+)?\" , ... lambda mo : mo . group ( 0 ) . capitalize (), ... s ) ... >>> titlecase ( \"they're bill's friends.\" ) \"They're Bill's Friends.\" See also istitle() . str. translate ( table , / ) Â¶ Return a copy of the string in which each character has been mapped through the given translation table. The table must be an object that implements indexing via __getitem__() , typically a mapping or sequence . When indexed by a Unicode ordinal (an integer), the table object can do any of the following: return a Unicode ordinal or a string, to map the character to one or more other characters; return None , to delete the character from the return string; or raise a LookupError exception, to map the character to itself. You can use str.maketrans() to create a translation map from character-to-character mappings in different formats. See also the codecs module for a more flexible approach to custom character mappings. str. upper ( ) Â¶ Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters [ 4 ] converted to uppercase. Note that s.upper().isupper() might be False if s contains uncased characters or if the Unicode category of the resulting character(s) is not âLuâ (Letter, uppercase), but e.g. âLtâ (Letter, titlecase). The uppercasing algorithm used is described in section 3.13 âDefault Case Foldingâ of the Unicode Standard . str. zfill ( width , / ) Â¶ Return a copy of the string left filled with ASCII '0' digits to make a string of length width . A leading sign prefix ( '+' / '-' ) is handled by inserting the padding after the sign character rather than before. The original string is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s) . For example: >>> \"42\" . zfill ( 5 ) '00042' >>> \"-42\" . zfill ( 5 ) '-0042' Formatted String Literals (f-strings) Â¶ Added in version 3.6. Changed in version 3.7: The await and async for can be used in expressions within f-strings. Changed in version 3.8: Added the debug specifier ( = ) Changed in version 3.12: Many restrictions on expressions within f-strings have been removed. Notably, nested strings, comments, and backslashes are now permitted. An f-string (formally a formatted string literal ) is a string literal that is prefixed with f or F . This type of string literal allows embedding the results of arbitrary Python expressions within replacement fields , which are delimited by curly brackets ( {} ). Each replacement field must contain an expression, optionally followed by: a debug specifier â an equal sign ( = ); a conversion specifier â !s , !r or !a ; and/or a format specifier prefixed with a colon ( : ). See the Lexical Analysis section on f-strings for details on the syntax of these fields. Debug specifier Â¶ Added in version 3.8. If a debug specifier â an equal sign ( = ) â appears after the replacement field expression, the resulting f-string will contain the expressionâs source, the equal sign, and the value of the expression. This is often useful for debugging: >>> number = 14.3 >>> f ' { number =} ' 'number=14.3' Whitespace before, inside and after the expression, as well as whitespace after the equal sign, is significant â it is retained in the result: >>> f ' { number - 4 = } ' ' number - 4 = 10.3' Conversion specifier Â¶ By default, the value of a replacement field expression is converted to a string using str() : >>> from fractions import Fraction >>> one_third = Fraction ( 1 , 3 ) >>> f ' { one_third } ' '1/3' When a debug specifier but no format specifier is used, the default conversion instead uses repr() : >>> f ' { one_third = } ' 'one_third = Fraction(1, 3)' The conversion can be specified explicitly using one of these specifiers: !s for str() !r for repr() !a for ascii() For example: >>> str ( one_third ) '1/3' >>> repr ( one_third ) 'Fraction(1, 3)' >>> f ' { one_third !s} is { one_third !r} ' '1/3 is Fraction(1, 3)' >>> string = \"Â¡koÄka ð¸!\" >>> ascii ( string ) \"'\\\\xa1ko\\\\u010dka \\\\U0001f638!'\" >>> f ' { string = !a} ' \"string = '\\\\xa1ko\\\\u010dka \\\\U0001f638!'\" Format specifier Â¶ After the expression has been evaluated, and possibly converted using an explicit conversion specifier, it is formatted using the format() function. If the replacement field includes a format specifier introduced by a colon ( : ), the specifier is passed to format() as the second argument. The result of format() is then used as the final value for the replacement field. For example: >>> from fractions import Fraction >>> one_third = Fraction ( 1 , 3 ) >>> f ' { one_third : .6f } ' '0.333333' >>> f ' { one_third : _^+10 } ' '___+1/3___' >>> >>> f ' { one_third !r: _^20 } ' '___Fraction(1, 3)___' >>> f ' { one_third = : ~>10 } ~' 'one_third = ~~~~~~~1/3~' Template String Literals (t-strings) Â¶ An t-string (formally a template string literal ) is a string literal that is prefixed with t or T . These strings follow the same syntax and evaluation rules as formatted string literals , with for the following differences: Rather than evaluating to a str object, template string literals evaluate to a string.templatelib.Template object. The format() protocol is not used. Instead, the format specifier and conversions (if any) are passed to a new Interpolation object that is created for each evaluated expression. It is up to code that processes the resulting Template object to decide how to handle format specifiers and conversions. Format specifiers containing nested replacement fields are evaluated eagerly, prior to being passed to the Interpolation object. For instance, an interpolation of the form {amount:.{precision}f} will evaluate the inner expression {precision} to determine the value of the format_spec attribute. If precision were to be 2 , the resulting format specifier would be '.2f' . When the equals sign '=' is provided in an interpolation expression, the text of the expression is appended to the literal string that precedes the relevant interpolation. This includes the equals sign and any surrounding whitespace. The Interpolation instance for the expression will be created as normal, except that conversion will be set to â r â ( repr() ) by default. If an explicit conversion or format specifier are provided, this will override the default behaviour. printf -style String Formatting Â¶ Note The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that lead to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and dictionaries correctly). Using formatted string literals , the str.format() interface, or string.Template may help avoid these errors. Each of these alternatives provides their own trade-offs and benefits of simplicity, flexibility, and/or extensibility. String objects have one unique built-in operation: the % operator (modulo). This is also known as the string formatting or interpolation operator. Given format % values (where format is a string), % conversion specifications in format are replaced with zero or more elements of values . The effect is similar to using the sprintf() function in the C language. For example: >>> print ( ' %s has %d quote types.' % ( 'Python' , 2 )) Python has 2 quote types. If format requires a single argument, values may be a single non-tuple object. [ 5 ] Otherwise, values must be a tuple with exactly the number of items specified by the format string, or a single mapping object (for example, a dictionary). A conversion specifier contains two or more characters and has the following components, which must occur in this order: The '%' character, which marks the start of the specifier. Mapping key (optional), consisting of a parenthesised sequence of characters (for example, (somename) ). Conversion flags (optional), which affect the result of some conversion types. Minimum field width (optional). If specified as an '*' (asterisk), the actual width is read from the next element of the tuple in values , and the object to convert comes after the minimum field width and optional precision. Precision (optional), given as a '.' (dot) followed by the precision. If specified as '*' (an asterisk), the actual precision is read from the next element of the tuple in values , and the value to convert comes after the precision. Length modifier (optional). Conversion type. When the right argument is a dictionary (or other mapping type), then the formats in the string must include a parenthesised mapping key into that dictionary inserted immediately after the '%' character. The mapping key selects the value to be formatted from the mapping. For example: >>> print ( ' %(language)s has %(number)03d quote types.' % ... { 'language' : \"Python\" , \"number\" : 2 }) Python has 002 quote types. In this case no * specifiers may occur in a format (since they require a sequential parameter list). The conversion flag characters are: Flag Meaning '#' The value conversion will use the âalternate formâ (where defined below). '0' The conversion will be zero padded for numeric values. '-' The converted value is left adjusted (overrides the '0' conversion if both are given). ' ' (a space) A blank should be left before a positive number (or empty string) produced by a signed conversion. '+' A sign character ( '+' or '-' ) will precede the conversion (overrides a âspaceâ flag). A length modifier ( h , l , or L ) may be present, but is ignored as it is not necessary for Python â so e.g. %ld is identical to %d . The conversion types are: Conversion Meaning Notes 'd' Signed integer decimal. 'i' Signed integer decimal. 'o' Signed octal value. (1) 'u' Obsolete type â it is identical to 'd' . (6) 'x' Signed hexadecimal (lowercase). (2) 'X' Signed hexadecimal (uppercase). (2) 'e' Floating-point exponential format (lowercase). (3) 'E' Floating-point exponential format (uppercase). (3) 'f' Floating-point decimal format. (3) 'F' Floating-point decimal format. (3) 'g' Floating-point format. Uses lowercase exponential format if exponent is less than -4 or not less than precision, decimal format otherwise. (4) 'G' Floating-point format. Uses uppercase exponential format if exponent is less than -4 or not less than precision, decimal format otherwise. (4) 'c' Single character (accepts integer or single character string). 'r' String (converts any Python object using repr() ). (5) 's' String (converts any Python object using str() ). (5) 'a' String (converts any Python object using ascii() ). (5) '%' No argument is converted, results in a '%' character in the result. Notes: The alternate form causes a leading octal specifier ( '0o' ) to be inserted before the first digit. The alternate form causes a leading '0x' or '0X' (depending on whether the 'x' or 'X' format was used) to be inserted before the first digit. The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, even if no digits follow it. The precision determines the number of digits after the decimal point and defaults to 6. The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, and trailing zeroes are not removed as they would otherwise be. The precision determines the number of significant digits before and after the decimal point and defaults to 6. If precision is N , the output is truncated to N characters. See PEP 237 . Since Python strings have an explicit length, %s conversions do not assume that '\\0' is the end of the string. Changed in version 3.1: %f conversions for numbers whose absolute value is over 1e50 are no longer replaced by %g conversions. Binary Sequence Types â bytes , bytearray , memoryview Â¶ The core built-in types for manipulating binary data are bytes and bytearray . They are supported by memoryview which uses the buffer protocol to access the memory of other binary objects without needing to make a copy. The array module supports efficient storage of basic data types like 32-bit integers and IEEE754 double-precision floating values. Bytes Objects Â¶ Bytes objects are immutable sequences of single bytes. Since many major binary protocols are based on the ASCII text encoding, bytes objects offer several methods that are only valid when working with ASCII compatible data and are closely related to string objects in a variety of other ways. class bytes ( source = b'' ) Â¶ class bytes ( source , encoding , errors = 'strict' ) Firstly, the syntax for bytes literals is largely the same as that for string literals, except that a b prefix is added: Single quotes: b'still allows embedded \"double\" quotes' Double quotes: b\"still allows embedded 'single' quotes\" Triple quoted: b'''3 single quotes''' , b\"\"\"3 double quotes\"\"\" Only ASCII characters are permitted in bytes literals (regardless of the declared source code encoding). Any binary values over 127 must be entered into bytes literals using the appropriate escape sequence. As with string literals, bytes literals may also use a r prefix to disable processing of escape sequences. See String and Bytes literals for more about the various forms of bytes literal, including supported escape sequences. While bytes literals and representations are based on ASCII text, bytes objects actually behave like immutable sequences of integers, with each value in the sequence restricted such that 0 <= x < 256 (attempts to violate this restriction will trigger ValueError ). This is done deliberately to emphasise that while many binary formats include ASCII based elements and can be usefully manipulated with some text-oriented algorithms, this is not generally the case for arbitrary binary data (blindly applying text processing algorithms to binary data formats that are not ASCII compatible will usually lead to data corruption). In addition to the literal forms, bytes objects can be created in a number of other ways: A zero-filled bytes object of a specified length: bytes(10) From an iterable of integers: bytes(range(20)) Copying existing binary data via the buffer protocol: bytes(obj) Also see the bytes built-in. Since 2 hexadecimal digits correspond precisely to a single byte, hexadecimal numbers are a commonly used format for describing binary data. Accordingly, the bytes type has an additional class method to read data in that format: classmethod fromhex ( string , / ) Â¶ This bytes class method returns a bytes object, decoding the given string object. The string must contain two hexadecimal digits per byte, with ASCII whitespace being ignored. >>> bytes . fromhex ( '2Ef0 F1f2 ' ) b'.\\xf0\\xf1\\xf2' Changed in version 3.7: bytes.fromhex() now skips all ASCII whitespace in the string, not just spaces. Changed in version 3.14: bytes.fromhex() now accepts ASCII bytes and bytes-like objects as input. A reverse conversion function exists to transform a bytes object into its hexadecimal representation. hex ( * , bytes_per_sep = 1 ) Â¶ hex ( sep , bytes_per_sep = 1 ) Return a string object containing two hexadecimal digits for each byte in the instance. >>> b ' \\xf0\\xf1\\xf2 ' . hex () 'f0f1f2' If you want to make the hex string easier to read, you can specify a single character separator sep parameter to include in the output. By default, this separator will be included between each byte. A second optional bytes_per_sep parameter controls the spacing. Positive values calculate the separator position from the right, negative values from the left. >>> value = b ' \\xf0\\xf1\\xf2 ' >>> value . hex ( '-' ) 'f0-f1-f2' >>> value . hex ( '_' , 2 ) 'f0_f1f2' >>> b 'UUDDLRLRAB' . hex ( ' ' , - 4 ) '55554444 4c524c52 4142' Added in version 3.5. Changed in version 3.8: bytes.hex() now supports optional sep and bytes_per_sep parameters to insert separators between bytes in the hex output. Since bytes objects are sequences of integers (akin to a tuple), for a bytes object b , b[0] will be an integer, while b[0:1] will be a bytes object of length 1. (This contrasts with text strings, where both indexing and slicing will produce a string of length 1) The representation of bytes objects uses the literal format ( b'...' ) since it is often more useful than e.g. bytes([46, 46, 46]) . You can always convert a bytes object into a list of integers using list(b) . Bytearray Objects Â¶ bytearray objects are a mutable counterpart to bytes objects. class bytearray ( source = b'' ) Â¶ class bytearray ( source , encoding , errors = 'strict' ) There is no dedicated literal syntax for bytearray objects, instead they are always created by calling the constructor: Creating an empty instance: bytearray() Creating a zero-filled instance with a given length: bytearray(10) From an iterable of integers: bytearray(range(20)) Copying existing binary data via the buffer protocol: bytearray(b'Hi!') As bytearray objects are mutable, they support the mutable sequence operations in addition to the common bytes and bytearray operations described in Bytes and Bytearray Operations . Also see the bytearray built-in. Since 2 hexadecimal digits correspond precisely to a single byte, hexadecimal numbers are a commonly used format for describing binary data. Accordingly, the bytearray type has an additional class method to read data in that format: classmethod fromhex ( string , / ) Â¶ This bytearray class method returns bytearray object, decoding the given string object. The string must contain two hexadecimal digits per byte, with ASCII whitespace being ignored. >>> bytearray . fromhex ( '2Ef0 F1f2 ' ) bytearray(b'.\\xf0\\xf1\\xf2') Changed in version 3.7: bytearray.fromhex() now skips all ASCII whitespace in the string, not just spaces. Changed in version 3.14: bytearray.fromhex() now accepts ASCII bytes and bytes-like objects as input. A reverse conversion function exists to transform a bytearray object into its hexadecimal representation. hex ( * , bytes_per_sep = 1 ) Â¶ hex ( sep , bytes_per_sep = 1 ) Return a string object containing two hexadecimal digits for each byte in the instance. >>> bytearray ( b ' \\xf0\\xf1\\xf2 ' ) . hex () 'f0f1f2' Added in version 3.5. Changed in version 3.8: Similar to bytes.hex() , bytearray.hex() now supports optional sep and bytes_per_sep parameters to insert separators between bytes in the hex output. resize ( size , / ) Â¶ Resize the bytearray to contain size bytes. size must be greater than or equal to 0. If the bytearray needs to shrink, bytes beyond size are truncated. If the bytearray needs to grow, all new bytes, those beyond size , will be set to null bytes. This is equivalent to: >>> def resize ( ba , size ): ... if len ( ba ) > size : ... del ba [ size :] ... else : ... ba += b ' \\0 ' * ( size - len ( ba )) Examples: >>> shrink = bytearray ( b 'abc' ) >>> shrink . resize ( 1 ) >>> ( shrink , len ( shrink )) (bytearray(b'a'), 1) >>> grow = bytearray ( b 'abc' ) >>> grow . resize ( 5 ) >>> ( grow , len ( grow )) (bytearray(b'abc\\x00\\x00'), 5) Added in version 3.14. Since bytearray objects are sequences of integers (akin to a list), for a bytearray object b , b[0] will be an integer, while b[0:1] will be a bytearray object of length 1. (This contrasts with text strings, where both indexing and slicing will produce a string of length 1) The representation of bytearray objects uses the bytes literal format ( bytearray(b'...') ) since it is often more useful than e.g. bytearray([46, 46, 46]) . You can always convert a bytearray object into a list of integers using list(b) . Bytes and Bytearray Operations Â¶ Both bytes and bytearray objects support the common sequence operations. They interoperate not just with operands of the same type, but with any bytes-like object . Due to this flexibility, they can be freely mixed in operations without causing errors. However, the return type of the result may depend on the order of operands. Note The methods on bytes and bytearray objects donât accept strings as their arguments, just as the methods on strings donât accept bytes as their arguments. For example, you have to write: a = \"abc\" b = a . replace ( \"a\" , \"f\" ) and: a = b \"abc\" b = a . replace ( b \"a\" , b \"f\" ) Some bytes and bytearray operations assume the use of ASCII compatible binary formats, and hence should be avoided when working with arbitrary binary data. These restrictions are covered below. Note Using these ASCII based operations to manipulate binary data that is not stored in an ASCII based format may lead to data corruption. The following methods on bytes and bytearray objects can be used with arbitrary binary data. bytes. count ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ bytearray. count ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of subsequence sub in the range [ start , end ]. Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an integer in the range 0 to 255. If sub is empty, returns the number of empty slices between characters which is the length of the bytes object plus one. Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the subsequence. bytes. removeprefix ( prefix , / ) Â¶ bytearray. removeprefix ( prefix , / ) Â¶ If the binary data starts with the prefix string, return bytes[len(prefix):] . Otherwise, return a copy of the original binary data: >>> b 'TestHook' . removeprefix ( b 'Test' ) b'Hook' >>> b 'BaseTestCase' . removeprefix ( b 'Test' ) b'BaseTestCase' The prefix may be any bytes-like object . Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. Added in version 3.9. bytes. removesuffix ( suffix , / ) Â¶ bytearray. removesuffix ( suffix , / ) Â¶ If the binary data ends with the suffix string and that suffix is not empty, return bytes[:-len(suffix)] . Otherwise, return a copy of the original binary data: >>> b 'MiscTests' . removesuffix ( b 'Tests' ) b'Misc' >>> b 'TmpDirMixin' . removesuffix ( b 'Tests' ) b'TmpDirMixin' The suffix may be any bytes-like object . Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. Added in version 3.9. bytes. decode ( encoding = 'utf-8' , errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ bytearray. decode ( encoding = 'utf-8' , errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ Return the bytes decoded to a str . encoding defaults to 'utf-8' ; see Standard Encodings for possible values. errors controls how decoding errors are handled. If 'strict' (the default), a UnicodeError exception is raised. Other possible values are 'ignore' , 'replace' , and any other name registered via codecs.register_error() . See Error Handlers for details. For performance reasons, the value of errors is not checked for validity unless a decoding error actually occurs, Python Development Mode is enabled or a debug build is used. Note Passing the encoding argument to str allows decoding any bytes-like object directly, without needing to make a temporary bytes or bytearray object. Changed in version 3.1: Added support for keyword arguments. Changed in version 3.9: The value of the errors argument is now checked in Python Development Mode and in debug mode . bytes. endswith ( suffix [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ bytearray. endswith ( suffix [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ Return True if the binary data ends with the specified suffix , otherwise return False . suffix can also be a tuple of suffixes to look for. With optional start , test beginning at that position. With optional end , stop comparing at that position. The suffix(es) to search for may be any bytes-like object . bytes. find ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ bytearray. find ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ Return the lowest index in the data where the subsequence sub is found, such that sub is contained in the slice s[start:end] . Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Return -1 if sub is not found. The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an integer in the range 0 to 255. Note The find() method should be used only if you need to know the position of sub . To check if sub is a substring or not, use the in operator: >>> b 'Py' in b 'Python' True Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the subsequence. bytes. index ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ bytearray. index ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ Like find() , but raise ValueError when the subsequence is not found. The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an integer in the range 0 to 255. Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the subsequence. bytes. join ( iterable , / ) Â¶ bytearray. join ( iterable , / ) Â¶ Return a bytes or bytearray object which is the concatenation of the binary data sequences in iterable . A TypeError will be raised if there are any values in iterable that are not bytes-like objects , including str objects. The separator between elements is the contents of the bytes or bytearray object providing this method. static bytes. maketrans ( from , to , / ) Â¶ static bytearray. maketrans ( from , to , / ) Â¶ This static method returns a translation table usable for bytes.translate() that will map each character in from into the character at the same position in to ; from and to must both be bytes-like objects and have the same length. Added in version 3.1. bytes. partition ( sep , / ) Â¶ bytearray. partition ( sep , / ) Â¶ Split the sequence at the first occurrence of sep , and return a 3-tuple containing the part before the separator, the separator itself or its bytearray copy, and the part after the separator. If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple containing a copy of the original sequence, followed by two empty bytes or bytearray objects. The separator to search for may be any bytes-like object . bytes. replace ( old , new , count = -1 , / ) Â¶ bytearray. replace ( old , new , count = -1 , / ) Â¶ Return a copy of the sequence with all occurrences of subsequence old replaced by new . If the optional argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced. The subsequence to search for and its replacement may be any bytes-like object . Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. bytes. rfind ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ bytearray. rfind ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ Return the highest index in the sequence where the subsequence sub is found, such that sub is contained within s[start:end] . Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation. Return -1 on failure. The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an integer in the range 0 to 255. Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the subsequence. bytes. rindex ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ bytearray. rindex ( sub [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ Like rfind() but raises ValueError when the subsequence sub is not found. The subsequence to search for may be any bytes-like object or an integer in the range 0 to 255. Changed in version 3.3: Also accept an integer in the range 0 to 255 as the subsequence. bytes. rpartition ( sep , / ) Â¶ bytearray. rpartition ( sep , / ) Â¶ Split the sequence at the last occurrence of sep , and return a 3-tuple containing the part before the separator, the separator itself or its bytearray copy, and the part after the separator. If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple containing two empty bytes or bytearray objects, followed by a copy of the original sequence. The separator to search for may be any bytes-like object . bytes. startswith ( prefix [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ bytearray. startswith ( prefix [ , start [ , end ] ] ) Â¶ Return True if the binary data starts with the specified prefix , otherwise return False . prefix can also be a tuple of prefixes to look for. With optional start , test beginning at that position. With optional end , stop comparing at that position. The prefix(es) to search for may be any bytes-like object . bytes. translate ( table , / , delete = b'' ) Â¶ bytearray. translate ( table , / , delete = b'' ) Â¶ Return a copy of the bytes or bytearray object where all bytes occurring in the optional argument delete are removed, and the remaining bytes have been mapped through the given translation table, which must be a bytes object of length 256. You can use the bytes.maketrans() method to create a translation table. Set the table argument to None for translations that only delete characters: >>> b 'read this short text' . translate ( None , b 'aeiou' ) b'rd ths shrt txt' Changed in version 3.6: delete is now supported as a keyword argument. The following methods on bytes and bytearray objects have default behaviours that assume the use of ASCII compatible binary formats, but can still be used with arbitrary binary data by passing appropriate arguments. Note that all of the bytearray methods in this section do not operate in place, and instead produce new objects. bytes. center ( width , fillbyte = b' ' , / ) Â¶ bytearray. center ( width , fillbyte = b' ' , / ) Â¶ Return a copy of the object centered in a sequence of length width . Padding is done using the specified fillbyte (default is an ASCII space). For bytes objects, the original sequence is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s) . Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. bytes. ljust ( width , fillbyte = b' ' , / ) Â¶ bytearray. ljust ( width , fillbyte = b' ' , / ) Â¶ Return a copy of the object left justified in a sequence of length width . Padding is done using the specified fillbyte (default is an ASCII space). For bytes objects, the original sequence is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s) . Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. bytes. lstrip ( bytes = None , / ) Â¶ bytearray. lstrip ( bytes = None , / ) Â¶ Return a copy of the sequence with specified leading bytes removed. The bytes argument is a binary sequence specifying the set of byte values to be removed. If omitted or None , the bytes argument defaults to removing ASCII whitespace. The bytes argument is not a prefix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped: >>> b ' spacious ' . lstrip () b'spacious ' >>> b 'www.example.com' . lstrip ( b 'cmowz.' ) b'example.com' The binary sequence of byte values to remove may be any bytes-like object . See removeprefix() for a method that will remove a single prefix string rather than all of a set of characters. For example: >>> b 'Arthur: three!' . lstrip ( b 'Arthur: ' ) b'ee!' >>> b 'Arthur: three!' . removeprefix ( b 'Arthur: ' ) b'three!' Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. bytes. rjust ( width , fillbyte = b' ' , / ) Â¶ bytearray. rjust ( width , fillbyte = b' ' , / ) Â¶ Return a copy of the object right justified in a sequence of length width . Padding is done using the specified fillbyte (default is an ASCII space). For bytes objects, the original sequence is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s) . Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. bytes. rsplit ( sep = None , maxsplit = -1 ) Â¶ bytearray. rsplit ( sep = None , maxsplit = -1 ) Â¶ Split the binary sequence into subsequences of the same type, using sep as the delimiter string. If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are done, the rightmost ones. If sep is not specified or None , any subsequence consisting solely of ASCII whitespace is a separator. Except for splitting from the right, rsplit() behaves like split() which is described in detail below. bytes. rstrip ( bytes = None , / ) Â¶ bytearray. rstrip ( bytes = None , / ) Â¶ Return a copy of the sequence with specified trailing bytes removed. The bytes argument is a binary sequence specifying the set of byte values to be removed. If omitted or None , the bytes argument defaults to removing ASCII whitespace. The bytes argument is not a suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped: >>> b ' spacious ' . rstrip () b' spacious' >>> b 'mississippi' . rstrip ( b 'ipz' ) b'mississ' The binary sequence of byte values to remove may be any bytes-like object . See removesuffix() for a method that will remove a single suffix string rather than all of a set of characters. For example: >>> b 'Monty Python' . rstrip ( b ' Python' ) b'M' >>> b 'Monty Python' . removesuffix ( b ' Python' ) b'Monty' Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. bytes. split ( sep = None , maxsplit = -1 ) Â¶ bytearray. split ( sep = None , maxsplit = -1 ) Â¶ Split the binary sequence into subsequences of the same type, using sep as the delimiter string. If maxsplit is given and non-negative, at most maxsplit splits are done (thus, the list will have at most maxsplit+1 elements). If maxsplit is not specified or is -1 , then there is no limit on the number of splits (all possible splits are made). If sep is given, consecutive delimiters are not grouped together and are deemed to delimit empty subsequences (for example, b'1,,2'.split(b',') returns [b'1', b'', b'2'] ). The sep argument may consist of a multibyte sequence as a single delimiter. Splitting an empty sequence with a specified separator returns [b''] or [bytearray(b'')] depending on the type of object being split. The sep argument may be any bytes-like object . For example: >>> b '1,2,3' . split ( b ',' ) [b'1', b'2', b'3'] >>> b '1,2,3' . split ( b ',' , maxsplit = 1 ) [b'1', b'2,3'] >>> b '1,2,,3,' . split ( b ',' ) [b'1', b'2', b'', b'3', b''] >>> b '1<>2<>3<4' . split ( b '<>' ) [b'1', b'2', b'3<4'] If sep is not specified or is None , a different splitting algorithm is applied: runs of consecutive ASCII whitespace are regarded as a single separator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the sequence has leading or trailing whitespace. Consequently, splitting an empty sequence or a sequence consisting solely of ASCII whitespace without a specified separator returns [] . For example: >>> b '1 2 3' . split () [b'1', b'2', b'3'] >>> b '1 2 3' . split ( maxsplit = 1 ) [b'1', b'2 3'] >>> b ' 1 2 3 ' . split () [b'1', b'2', b'3'] bytes. strip ( bytes = None , / ) Â¶ bytearray. strip ( bytes = None , / ) Â¶ Return a copy of the sequence with specified leading and trailing bytes removed. The bytes argument is a binary sequence specifying the set of byte values to be removed. If omitted or None , the bytes argument defaults to removing ASCII whitespace. The bytes argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped: >>> b ' spacious ' . strip () b'spacious' >>> b 'www.example.com' . strip ( b 'cmowz.' ) b'example' The binary sequence of byte values to remove may be any bytes-like object . Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. The following methods on bytes and bytearray objects assume the use of ASCII compatible binary formats and should not be applied to arbitrary binary data. Note that all of the bytearray methods in this section do not operate in place, and instead produce new objects. bytes. capitalize ( ) Â¶ bytearray. capitalize ( ) Â¶ Return a copy of the sequence with each byte interpreted as an ASCII character, and the first byte capitalized and the rest lowercased. Non-ASCII byte values are passed through unchanged. Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. bytes. expandtabs ( tabsize = 8 ) Â¶ bytearray. expandtabs ( tabsize = 8 ) Â¶ Return a copy of the sequence where all ASCII tab characters are replaced by one or more ASCII spaces, depending on the current column and the given tab size. Tab positions occur every tabsize bytes (default is 8, giving tab positions at columns 0, 8, 16 and so on). To expand the sequence, the current column is set to zero and the sequence is examined byte by byte. If the byte is an ASCII tab character ( b'\\t' ), one or more space characters are inserted in the result until the current column is equal to the next tab position. (The tab character itself is not copied.) If the current byte is an ASCII newline ( b'\\n' ) or carriage return ( b'\\r' ), it is copied and the current column is reset to zero. Any other byte value is copied unchanged and the current column is incremented by one regardless of how the byte value is represented when printed: >>> b '01 \\t 012 \\t 0123 \\t 01234' . expandtabs () b'01 012 0123 01234' >>> b '01 \\t 012 \\t 0123 \\t 01234' . expandtabs ( 4 ) b'01 012 0123 01234' Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. bytes. isalnum ( ) Â¶ bytearray. isalnum ( ) Â¶ Return True if all bytes in the sequence are alphabetical ASCII characters or ASCII decimal digits and the sequence is not empty, False otherwise. Alphabetic ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' . ASCII decimal digits are those byte values in the sequence b'0123456789' . For example: >>> b 'ABCabc1' . isalnum () True >>> b 'ABC abc1' . isalnum () False bytes. isalpha ( ) Â¶ bytearray. isalpha ( ) Â¶ Return True if all bytes in the sequence are alphabetic ASCII characters and the sequence is not empty, False otherwise. Alphabetic ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' . For example: >>> b 'ABCabc' . isalpha () True >>> b 'ABCabc1' . isalpha () False bytes. isascii ( ) Â¶ bytearray. isascii ( ) Â¶ Return True if the sequence is empty or all bytes in the sequence are ASCII, False otherwise. ASCII bytes are in the range 0-0x7F. Added in version 3.7. bytes. isdigit ( ) Â¶ bytearray. isdigit ( ) Â¶ Return True if all bytes in the sequence are ASCII decimal digits and the sequence is not empty, False otherwise. ASCII decimal digits are those byte values in the sequence b'0123456789' . For example: >>> b '1234' . isdigit () True >>> b '1.23' . isdigit () False bytes. islower ( ) Â¶ bytearray. islower ( ) Â¶ Return True if there is at least one lowercase ASCII character in the sequence and no uppercase ASCII characters, False otherwise. For example: >>> b 'hello world' . islower () True >>> b 'Hello world' . islower () False Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' . Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' . bytes. isspace ( ) Â¶ bytearray. isspace ( ) Â¶ Return True if all bytes in the sequence are ASCII whitespace and the sequence is not empty, False otherwise. ASCII whitespace characters are those byte values in the sequence b' \\t\\n\\r\\x0b\\f' (space, tab, newline, carriage return, vertical tab, form feed). bytes. istitle ( ) Â¶ bytearray. istitle ( ) Â¶ Return True if the sequence is ASCII titlecase and the sequence is not empty, False otherwise. See bytes.title() for more details on the definition of âtitlecaseâ. For example: >>> b 'Hello World' . istitle () True >>> b 'Hello world' . istitle () False bytes. isupper ( ) Â¶ bytearray. isupper ( ) Â¶ Return True if there is at least one uppercase alphabetic ASCII character in the sequence and no lowercase ASCII characters, False otherwise. For example: >>> b 'HELLO WORLD' . isupper () True >>> b 'Hello world' . isupper () False Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' . Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' . bytes. lower ( ) Â¶ bytearray. lower ( ) Â¶ Return a copy of the sequence with all the uppercase ASCII characters converted to their corresponding lowercase counterpart. For example: >>> b 'Hello World' . lower () b'hello world' Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' . Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' . Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. bytes. splitlines ( keepends = False ) Â¶ bytearray. splitlines ( keepends = False ) Â¶ Return a list of the lines in the binary sequence, breaking at ASCII line boundaries. This method uses the universal newlines approach to splitting lines. Line breaks are not included in the resulting list unless keepends is given and true. For example: >>> b 'ab c \\n\\n de fg \\r kl \\r\\n ' . splitlines () [b'ab c', b'', b'de fg', b'kl'] >>> b 'ab c \\n\\n de fg \\r kl \\r\\n ' . splitlines ( keepends = True ) [b'ab c\\n', b'\\n', b'de fg\\r', b'kl\\r\\n'] Unlike split() when a delimiter string sep is given, this method returns an empty list for the empty string, and a terminal line break does not result in an extra line: >>> b \"\" . split ( b ' \\n ' ), b \"Two lines \\n \" . split ( b ' \\n ' ) ([b''], [b'Two lines', b'']) >>> b \"\" . splitlines (), b \"One line \\n \" . splitlines () ([], [b'One line']) bytes. swapcase ( ) Â¶ bytearray. swapcase ( ) Â¶ Return a copy of the sequence with all the lowercase ASCII characters converted to their corresponding uppercase counterpart and vice-versa. For example: >>> b 'Hello World' . swapcase () b'hELLO wORLD' Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' . Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' . Unlike str.swapcase() , it is always the case that bin.swapcase().swapcase() == bin for the binary versions. Case conversions are symmetrical in ASCII, even though that is not generally true for arbitrary Unicode code points. Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. bytes. title ( ) Â¶ bytearray. title ( ) Â¶ Return a titlecased version of the binary sequence where words start with an uppercase ASCII character and the remaining characters are lowercase. Uncased byte values are left unmodified. For example: >>> b 'Hello world' . title () b'Hello World' Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' . Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' . All other byte values are uncased. The algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a word as groups of consecutive letters. The definition works in many contexts but it means that apostrophes in contractions and possessives form word boundaries, which may not be the desired result: >>> b \"they're bill's friends from the UK\" . title () b\"They'Re Bill'S Friends From The Uk\" A workaround for apostrophes can be constructed using regular expressions: >>> import re >>> def titlecase ( s ): ... return re . sub ( rb \"[A-Za-z]+('[A-Za-z]+)?\" , ... lambda mo : mo . group ( 0 )[ 0 : 1 ] . upper () + ... mo . group ( 0 )[ 1 :] . lower (), ... s ) ... >>> titlecase ( b \"they're bill's friends.\" ) b\"They're Bill's Friends.\" Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. bytes. upper ( ) Â¶ bytearray. upper ( ) Â¶ Return a copy of the sequence with all the lowercase ASCII characters converted to their corresponding uppercase counterpart. For example: >>> b 'Hello World' . upper () b'HELLO WORLD' Lowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' . Uppercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' . Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. bytes. zfill ( width , / ) Â¶ bytearray. zfill ( width , / ) Â¶ Return a copy of the sequence left filled with ASCII b'0' digits to make a sequence of length width . A leading sign prefix ( b'+' / b'-' ) is handled by inserting the padding after the sign character rather than before. For bytes objects, the original sequence is returned if width is less than or equal to len(seq) . For example: >>> b \"42\" . zfill ( 5 ) b'00042' >>> b \"-42\" . zfill ( 5 ) b'-0042' Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. printf -style Bytes Formatting Â¶ Note The formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that lead to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and dictionaries correctly). If the value being printed may be a tuple or dictionary, wrap it in a tuple. Bytes objects ( bytes / bytearray ) have one unique built-in operation: the % operator (modulo). This is also known as the bytes formatting or interpolation operator. Given format % values (where format is a bytes object), % conversion specifications in format are replaced with zero or more elements of values . The effect is similar to using the sprintf() in the C language. If format requires a single argument, values may be a single non-tuple object. [ 5 ] Otherwise, values must be a tuple with exactly the number of items specified by the format bytes object, or a single mapping object (for example, a dictionary). A conversion specifier contains two or more characters and has the following components, which must occur in this order: The '%' character, which marks the start of the specifier. Mapping key (optional), consisting of a parenthesised sequence of characters (for example, (somename) ). Conversion flags (optional), which affect the result of some conversion types. Minimum field width (optional). If specified as an '*' (asterisk), the actual width is read from the next element of the tuple in values , and the object to convert comes after the minimum field width and optional precision. Precision (optional), given as a '.' (dot) followed by the precision. If specified as '*' (an asterisk), the actual precision is read from the next element of the tuple in values , and the value to convert comes after the precision. Length modifier (optional). Conversion type. When the right argument is a dictionary (or other mapping type), then the formats in the bytes object must include a parenthesised mapping key into that dictionary inserted immediately after the '%' character. The mapping key selects the value to be formatted from the mapping. For example: >>> print ( b ' %(language)s has %(number)03d quote types.' % ... { b 'language' : b \"Python\" , b \"number\" : 2 }) b'Python has 002 quote types.' In this case no * specifiers may occur in a format (since they require a sequential parameter list). The conversion flag characters are: Flag Meaning '#' The value conversion will use the âalternate formâ (where defined below). '0' The conversion will be zero padded for numeric values. '-' The converted value is left adjusted (overrides the '0' conversion if both are given). ' ' (a space) A blank should be left before a positive number (or empty string) produced by a signed conversion. '+' A sign character ( '+' or '-' ) will precede the conversion (overrides a âspaceâ flag). A length modifier ( h , l , or L ) may be present, but is ignored as it is not necessary for Python â so e.g. %ld is identical to %d . The conversion types are: Conversion Meaning Notes 'd' Signed integer decimal. 'i' Signed integer decimal. 'o' Signed octal value. (1) 'u' Obsolete type â it is identical to 'd' . (8) 'x' Signed hexadecimal (lowercase). (2) 'X' Signed hexadecimal (uppercase). (2) 'e' Floating-point exponential format (lowercase). (3) 'E' Floating-point exponential format (uppercase). (3) 'f' Floating-point decimal format. (3) 'F' Floating-point decimal format. (3) 'g' Floating-point format. Uses lowercase exponential format if exponent is less than -4 or not less than precision, decimal format otherwise. (4) 'G' Floating-point format. Uses uppercase exponential format if exponent is less than -4 or not less than precision, decimal format otherwise. (4) 'c' Single byte (accepts integer or single byte objects). 'b' Bytes (any object that follows the buffer protocol or has __bytes__() ). (5) 's' 's' is an alias for 'b' and should only be used for Python2/3 code bases. (6) 'a' Bytes (converts any Python object using repr(obj).encode('ascii', 'backslashreplace') ). (5) 'r' 'r' is an alias for 'a' and should only be used for Python2/3 code bases. (7) '%' No argument is converted, results in a '%' character in the result. Notes: The alternate form causes a leading octal specifier ( '0o' ) to be inserted before the first digit. The alternate form causes a leading '0x' or '0X' (depending on whether the 'x' or 'X' format was used) to be inserted before the first digit. The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, even if no digits follow it. The precision determines the number of digits after the decimal point and defaults to 6. The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, and trailing zeroes are not removed as they would otherwise be. The precision determines the number of significant digits before and after the decimal point and defaults to 6. If precision is N , the output is truncated to N characters. b'%s' is deprecated, but will not be removed during the 3.x series. b'%r' is deprecated, but will not be removed during the 3.x series. See PEP 237 . Note The bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it always produces a new object, even if no changes were made. See also PEP 461 - Adding % formatting to bytes and bytearray Added in version 3.5. Memory Views Â¶ memoryview objects allow Python code to access the internal data of an object that supports the buffer protocol without copying. class memoryview ( object ) Â¶ Create a memoryview that references object . object must support the buffer protocol. Built-in objects that support the buffer protocol include bytes and bytearray . A memoryview has the notion of an element , which is the atomic memory unit handled by the originating object . For many simple types such as bytes and bytearray , an element is a single byte, but other types such as array.array may have bigger elements. len(view) is equal to the length of tolist , which is the nested list representation of the view. If view.ndim = 1 , this is equal to the number of elements in the view. Changed in version 3.12: If view.ndim == 0 , len(view) now raises TypeError instead of returning 1. The itemsize attribute will give you the number of bytes in a single element. A memoryview supports slicing and indexing to expose its data. One-dimensional slicing will result in a subview: >>> v = memoryview ( b 'abcefg' ) >>> v [ 1 ] 98 >>> v [ - 1 ] 103 >>> v [ 1 : 4 ] <memory at 0x7f3ddc9f4350> >>> bytes ( v [ 1 : 4 ]) b'bce' If format is one of the native format specifiers from the struct module, indexing with an integer or a tuple of integers is also supported and returns a single element with the correct type. One-dimensional memoryviews can be indexed with an integer or a one-integer tuple. Multi-dimensional memoryviews can be indexed with tuples of exactly ndim integers where ndim is the number of dimensions. Zero-dimensional memoryviews can be indexed with the empty tuple. Here is an example with a non-byte format: >>> import array >>> a = array . array ( 'l' , [ - 11111111 , 22222222 , - 33333333 , 44444444 ]) >>> m = memoryview ( a ) >>> m [ 0 ] -11111111 >>> m [ - 1 ] 44444444 >>> m [:: 2 ] . tolist () [-11111111, -33333333] If the underlying object is writable, the memoryview supports one-dimensional slice assignment. Resizing is not allowed: >>> data = bytearray ( b 'abcefg' ) >>> v = memoryview ( data ) >>> v . readonly False >>> v [ 0 ] = ord ( b 'z' ) >>> data bytearray(b'zbcefg') >>> v [ 1 : 4 ] = b '123' >>> data bytearray(b'z123fg') >>> v [ 2 : 3 ] = b 'spam' Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 1 , in <module> ValueError : memoryview assignment: lvalue and rvalue have different structures >>> v [ 2 : 6 ] = b 'spam' >>> data bytearray(b'z1spam') One-dimensional memoryviews of hashable (read-only) types with formats âBâ, âbâ or âcâ are also hashable. The hash is defined as hash(m) == hash(m.tobytes()) : >>> v = memoryview ( b 'abcefg' ) >>> hash ( v ) == hash ( b 'abcefg' ) True >>> hash ( v [ 2 : 4 ]) == hash ( b 'ce' ) True >>> hash ( v [:: - 2 ]) == hash ( b 'abcefg' [:: - 2 ]) True Changed in version 3.3: One-dimensional memoryviews can now be sliced. One-dimensional memoryviews with formats âBâ, âbâ or âcâ are now hashable . Changed in version 3.4: memoryview is now registered automatically with collections.abc.Sequence Changed in version 3.5: memoryviews can now be indexed with tuple of integers. Changed in version 3.14: memoryview is now a generic type . memoryview has several methods: __eq__ ( exporter ) Â¶ A memoryview and a PEP 3118 exporter are equal if their shapes are equivalent and if all corresponding values are equal when the operandsâ respective format codes are interpreted using struct syntax. For the subset of struct format strings currently supported by tolist() , v and w are equal if v.tolist() == w.tolist() : >>> import array >>> a = array . array ( 'I' , [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]) >>> b = array . array ( 'd' , [ 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 , 5.0 ]) >>> c = array . array ( 'b' , [ 5 , 3 , 1 ]) >>> x = memoryview ( a ) >>> y = memoryview ( b ) >>> x == a == y == b True >>> x . tolist () == a . tolist () == y . tolist () == b . tolist () True >>> z = y [:: - 2 ] >>> z == c True >>> z . tolist () == c . tolist () True If either format string is not supported by the struct module, then the objects will always compare as unequal (even if the format strings and buffer contents are identical): >>> from ctypes import BigEndianStructure , c_long >>> class BEPoint ( BigEndianStructure ): ... _fields_ = [( \"x\" , c_long ), ( \"y\" , c_long )] ... >>> point = BEPoint ( 100 , 200 ) >>> a = memoryview ( point ) >>> b = memoryview ( point ) >>> a == point False >>> a == b False Note that, as with floating-point numbers, v is w does not imply v == w for memoryview objects. Changed in version 3.3: Previous versions compared the raw memory disregarding the item format and the logical array structure. tobytes ( order = 'C' ) Â¶ Return the data in the buffer as a bytestring. This is equivalent to calling the bytes constructor on the memoryview. >>> m = memoryview ( b \"abc\" ) >>> m . tobytes () b'abc' >>> bytes ( m ) b'abc' For non-contiguous arrays the result is equal to the flattened list representation with all elements converted to bytes. tobytes() supports all format strings, including those that are not in struct module syntax. Added in version 3.8: order can be {âCâ, âFâ, âAâ}. When order is âCâ or âFâ, the data of the original array is converted to C or Fortran order. For contiguous views, âAâ returns an exact copy of the physical memory. In particular, in-memory Fortran order is preserved. For non-contiguous views, the data is converted to C first. order=None is the same as order=âCâ . hex ( * , bytes_per_sep = 1 ) Â¶ hex ( sep , bytes_per_sep = 1 ) Return a string object containing two hexadecimal digits for each byte in the buffer. >>> m = memoryview ( b \"abc\" ) >>> m . hex () '616263' Added in version 3.5. Changed in version 3.8: Similar to bytes.hex() , memoryview.hex() now supports optional sep and bytes_per_sep parameters to insert separators between bytes in the hex output. tolist ( ) Â¶ Return the data in the buffer as a list of elements. >>> memoryview ( b 'abc' ) . tolist () [97, 98, 99] >>> import array >>> a = array . array ( 'd' , [ 1.1 , 2.2 , 3.3 ]) >>> m = memoryview ( a ) >>> m . tolist () [1.1, 2.2, 3.3] Changed in version 3.3: tolist() now supports all single character native formats in struct module syntax as well as multi-dimensional representations. toreadonly ( ) Â¶ Return a readonly version of the memoryview object. The original memoryview object is unchanged. >>> m = memoryview ( bytearray ( b 'abc' )) >>> mm = m . toreadonly () >>> mm . tolist () [97, 98, 99] >>> mm [ 0 ] = 42 Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 1 , in <module> TypeError : cannot modify read-only memory >>> m [ 0 ] = 43 >>> mm . tolist () [43, 98, 99] Added in version 3.8. release ( ) Â¶ Release the underlying buffer exposed by the memoryview object. Many objects take special actions when a view is held on them (for example, a bytearray would temporarily forbid resizing); therefore, calling release() is handy to remove these restrictions (and free any dangling resources) as soon as possible. After this method has been called, any further operation on the view raises a ValueError (except release() itself which can be called multiple times): >>> m = memoryview ( b 'abc' ) >>> m . release () >>> m [ 0 ] Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 1 , in <module> ValueError : operation forbidden on released memoryview object The context management protocol can be used for a similar effect, using the with statement: >>> with memoryview ( b 'abc' ) as m : ... m [ 0 ] ... 97 >>> m [ 0 ] Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 1 , in <module> ValueError : operation forbidden on released memoryview object Added in version 3.2. cast ( format , / ) Â¶ cast ( format , shape , / ) Cast a memoryview to a new format or shape. shape defaults to [byte_length//new_itemsize] , which means that the result view will be one-dimensional. The return value is a new memoryview, but the buffer itself is not copied. Supported casts are 1D -> C- contiguous and C-contiguous -> 1D. The destination format is restricted to a single element native format in struct syntax. One of the formats must be a byte format (âBâ, âbâ or âcâ). The byte length of the result must be the same as the original length. Note that all byte lengths may depend on the operating system. Cast 1D/long to 1D/unsigned bytes: >>> import array >>> a = array . array ( 'l' , [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) >>> x = memoryview ( a ) >>> x . format 'l' >>> x . itemsize 8 >>> len ( x ) 3 >>> x . nbytes 24 >>> y = x . cast ( 'B' ) >>> y . format 'B' >>> y . itemsize 1 >>> len ( y ) 24 >>> y . nbytes 24 Cast 1D/unsigned bytes to 1D/char: >>> b = bytearray ( b 'zyz' ) >>> x = memoryview ( b ) >>> x [ 0 ] = b 'a' Traceback (most recent call last): ... TypeError : memoryview: invalid type for format 'B' >>> y = x . cast ( 'c' ) >>> y [ 0 ] = b 'a' >>> b bytearray(b'ayz') Cast 1D/bytes to 3D/ints to 1D/signed char: >>> import struct >>> buf = struct . pack ( \"i\" * 12 , * list ( range ( 12 ))) >>> x = memoryview ( buf ) >>> y = x . cast ( 'i' , shape = [ 2 , 2 , 3 ]) >>> y . tolist () [[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]], [[6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11]]] >>> y . format 'i' >>> y . itemsize 4 >>> len ( y ) 2 >>> y . nbytes 48 >>> z = y . cast ( 'b' ) >>> z . format 'b' >>> z . itemsize 1 >>> len ( z ) 48 >>> z . nbytes 48 Cast 1D/unsigned long to 2D/unsigned long: >>> buf = struct . pack ( \"L\" * 6 , * list ( range ( 6 ))) >>> x = memoryview ( buf ) >>> y = x . cast ( 'L' , shape = [ 2 , 3 ]) >>> len ( y ) 2 >>> y . nbytes 48 >>> y . tolist () [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5]] Added in version 3.3. Changed in version 3.5: The source format is no longer restricted when casting to a byte view. count ( value , / ) Â¶ Count the number of occurrences of value . Added in version 3.14. index ( value , start = 0 , stop = sys.maxsize , / ) Â¶ Return the index of the first occurrence of value (at or after index start and before index stop ). Raises a ValueError if value cannot be found. Added in version 3.14. There are also several readonly attributes available: obj Â¶ The underlying object of the memoryview: >>> b = bytearray ( b 'xyz' ) >>> m = memoryview ( b ) >>> m . obj is b True Added in version 3.3. nbytes Â¶ nbytes == product(shape) * itemsize == len(m.tobytes()) . This is the amount of space in bytes that the array would use in a contiguous representation. It is not necessarily equal to len(m) : >>> import array >>> a = array . array ( 'i' , [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ]) >>> m = memoryview ( a ) >>> len ( m ) 5 >>> m . nbytes 20 >>> y = m [:: 2 ] >>> len ( y ) 3 >>> y . nbytes 12 >>> len ( y . tobytes ()) 12 Multi-dimensional arrays: >>> import struct >>> buf = struct . pack ( \"d\" * 12 , * [ 1.5 * x for x in range ( 12 )]) >>> x = memoryview ( buf ) >>> y = x . cast ( 'd' , shape = [ 3 , 4 ]) >>> y . tolist () [[0.0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5], [6.0, 7.5, 9.0, 10.5], [12.0, 13.5, 15.0, 16.5]] >>> len ( y ) 3 >>> y . nbytes 96 Added in version 3.3. readonly Â¶ A bool indicating whether the memory is read only. format Â¶ A string containing the format (in struct module style) for each element in the view. A memoryview can be created from exporters with arbitrary format strings, but some methods (e.g. tolist() ) are restricted to native single element formats. Changed in version 3.3: format 'B' is now handled according to the struct module syntax. This means that memoryview(b'abc')[0] == b'abc'[0] == 97 . itemsize Â¶ The size in bytes of each element of the memoryview: >>> import array , struct >>> m = memoryview ( array . array ( 'H' , [ 32000 , 32001 , 32002 ])) >>> m . itemsize 2 >>> m [ 0 ] 32000 >>> struct . calcsize ( 'H' ) == m . itemsize True ndim Â¶ An integer indicating how many dimensions of a multi-dimensional array the memory represents. shape Â¶ A tuple of integers the length of ndim giving the shape of the memory as an N-dimensional array. Changed in version 3.3: An empty tuple instead of None when ndim = 0. strides Â¶ A tuple of integers the length of ndim giving the size in bytes to access each element for each dimension of the array. Changed in version 3.3: An empty tuple instead of None when ndim = 0. suboffsets Â¶ Used internally for PIL-style arrays. The value is informational only. c_contiguous Â¶ A bool indicating whether the memory is C- contiguous . Added in version 3.3. f_contiguous Â¶ A bool indicating whether the memory is Fortran contiguous . Added in version 3.3. contiguous Â¶ A bool indicating whether the memory is contiguous . Added in version 3.3. Set Types â set , frozenset Â¶ A set object is an unordered collection of distinct hashable objects. Common uses include membership testing, removing duplicates from a sequence, and computing mathematical operations such as intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference. (For other containers see the built-in dict , list , and tuple classes, and the collections module.) Like other collections, sets support x in set , len(set) , and for x in set . Being an unordered collection, sets do not record element position or order of insertion. Accordingly, sets do not support indexing, slicing, or other sequence-like behavior. There are currently two built-in set types, set and frozenset . The set type is mutable â the contents can be changed using methods like add() and remove() . Since it is mutable, it has no hash value and cannot be used as either a dictionary key or as an element of another set. The frozenset type is immutable and hashable â its contents cannot be altered after it is created; it can therefore be used as a dictionary key or as an element of another set. Non-empty sets (not frozensets) can be created by placing a comma-separated list of elements within braces, for example: {'jack', 'sjoerd'} , in addition to the set constructor. The constructors for both classes work the same: class set ( iterable = () , / ) Â¶ class frozenset ( iterable = () , / ) Â¶ Return a new set or frozenset object whose elements are taken from iterable . The elements of a set must be hashable . To represent sets of sets, the inner sets must be frozenset objects. If iterable is not specified, a new empty set is returned. Sets can be created by several means: Use a comma-separated list of elements within braces: {'jack', 'sjoerd'} Use a set comprehension: {c for c in 'abracadabra' if c not in 'abc'} Use the type constructor: set() , set('foobar') , set(['a', 'b', 'foo']) Instances of set and frozenset provide the following operations: len(s) Return the number of elements in set s (cardinality of s ). x in s Test x for membership in s . x not in s Test x for non-membership in s . frozenset. isdisjoint ( other , / ) Â¶ set. isdisjoint ( other , / ) Â¶ Return True if the set has no elements in common with other . Sets are disjoint if and only if their intersection is the empty set. frozenset. issubset ( other , / ) Â¶ set. issubset ( other , / ) Â¶ set <= other Test whether every element in the set is in other . set < other Test whether the set is a proper subset of other , that is, set <= other and set != other . frozenset. issuperset ( other , / ) Â¶ set. issuperset ( other , / ) Â¶ set >= other Test whether every element in other is in the set. set > other Test whether the set is a proper superset of other , that is, set >= other and set != other . frozenset. union ( * others ) Â¶ set. union ( * others ) Â¶ set | other | ... Return a new set with elements from the set and all others. frozenset. intersection ( * others ) Â¶ set. intersection ( * others ) Â¶ set & other & ... Return a new set with elements common to the set and all others. frozenset. difference ( * others ) Â¶ set. difference ( * others ) Â¶ set - other - ... Return a new set with elements in the set that are not in the others. frozenset. symmetric_difference ( other , / ) Â¶ set. symmetric_difference ( other , / ) Â¶ set ^ other Return a new set with elements in either the set or other but not both. frozenset. copy ( ) Â¶ set. copy ( ) Â¶ Return a shallow copy of the set. Note, the non-operator versions of union() , intersection() , difference() , symmetric_difference() , issubset() , and issuperset() methods will accept any iterable as an argument. In contrast, their operator based counterparts require their arguments to be sets. This precludes error-prone constructions like set('abc') & 'cbs' in favor of the more readable set('abc').intersection('cbs') . Both set and frozenset support set to set comparisons. Two sets are equal if and only if every element of each set is contained in the other (each is a subset of the other). A set is less than another set if and only if the first set is a proper subset of the second set (is a subset, but is not equal). A set is greater than another set if and only if the first set is a proper superset of the second set (is a superset, but is not equal). Instances of set are compared to instances of frozenset based on their members. For example, set('abc') == frozenset('abc') returns True and so does set('abc') in set([frozenset('abc')]) . The subset and equality comparisons do not generalize to a total ordering function. For example, any two nonempty disjoint sets are not equal and are not subsets of each other, so all of the following return False : a<b , a==b , or a>b . Since sets only define partial ordering (subset relationships), the output of the list.sort() method is undefined for lists of sets. Set elements, like dictionary keys, must be hashable . Binary operations that mix set instances with frozenset return the type of the first operand. For example: frozenset('ab') | set('bc') returns an instance of frozenset . The following table lists operations available for set that do not apply to immutable instances of frozenset : set. update ( * others ) Â¶ set |= other | ... Update the set, adding elements from all others. set. intersection_update ( * others ) Â¶ set &= other & ... Update the set, keeping only elements found in it and all others. set. difference_update ( * others ) Â¶ set -= other | ... Update the set, removing elements found in others. set. symmetric_difference_update ( other , / ) Â¶ set ^= other Update the set, keeping only elements found in either set, but not in both. set. add ( elem , / ) Â¶ Add element elem to the set. set. remove ( elem , / ) Â¶ Remove element elem from the set. Raises KeyError if elem is not contained in the set. set. discard ( elem , / ) Â¶ Remove element elem from the set if it is present. set. pop ( ) Â¶ Remove and return an arbitrary element from the set. Raises KeyError if the set is empty. set. clear ( ) Â¶ Remove all elements from the set. Note, the non-operator versions of the update() , intersection_update() , difference_update() , and symmetric_difference_update() methods will accept any iterable as an argument. Note, the elem argument to the __contains__() , remove() , and discard() methods may be a set. To support searching for an equivalent frozenset, a temporary one is created from elem . Mapping Types â dict Â¶ A mapping object maps hashable values to arbitrary objects. Mappings are mutable objects. There is currently only one standard mapping type, the dictionary . (For other containers see the built-in list , set , and tuple classes, and the collections module.) A dictionaryâs keys are almost arbitrary values. Values that are not hashable , that is, values containing lists, dictionaries or other mutable types (that are compared by value rather than by object identity) may not be used as keys. Values that compare equal (such as 1 , 1.0 , and True ) can be used interchangeably to index the same dictionary entry. class dict ( ** kwargs ) Â¶ class dict ( mapping , / , ** kwargs ) class dict ( iterable , / , ** kwargs ) Return a new dictionary initialized from an optional positional argument and a possibly empty set of keyword arguments. Dictionaries can be created by several means: Use a comma-separated list of key: value pairs within braces: {'jack': 4098, 'sjoerd': 4127} or {4098: 'jack', 4127: 'sjoerd'} Use a dict comprehension: {} , {x: x ** 2 for x in range(10)} Use the type constructor: dict() , dict([('foo', 100), ('bar', 200)]) , dict(foo=100, bar=200) If no positional argument is given, an empty dictionary is created. If a positional argument is given and it defines a keys() method, a dictionary is created by calling __getitem__() on the argument with each returned key from the method. Otherwise, the positional argument must be an iterable object. Each item in the iterable must itself be an iterable with exactly two elements. The first element of each item becomes a key in the new dictionary, and the second element the corresponding value. If a key occurs more than once, the last value for that key becomes the corresponding value in the new dictionary. If keyword arguments are given, the keyword arguments and their values are added to the dictionary created from the positional argument. If a key being added is already present, the value from the keyword argument replaces the value from the positional argument. Dictionaries compare equal if and only if they have the same (key, value) pairs (regardless of ordering). Order comparisons (â<â, â<=â, â>=â, â>â) raise TypeError . To illustrate dictionary creation and equality, the following examples all return a dictionary equal to {\"one\": 1, \"two\": 2, \"three\": 3} : >>> a = dict ( one = 1 , two = 2 , three = 3 ) >>> b = { 'one' : 1 , 'two' : 2 , 'three' : 3 } >>> c = dict ( zip ([ 'one' , 'two' , 'three' ], [ 1 , 2 , 3 ])) >>> d = dict ([( 'two' , 2 ), ( 'one' , 1 ), ( 'three' , 3 )]) >>> e = dict ({ 'three' : 3 , 'one' : 1 , 'two' : 2 }) >>> f = dict ({ 'one' : 1 , 'three' : 3 }, two = 2 ) >>> a == b == c == d == e == f True Providing keyword arguments as in the first example only works for keys that are valid Python identifiers. Otherwise, any valid keys can be used. Dictionaries preserve insertion order. Note that updating a key does not affect the order. Keys added after deletion are inserted at the end. >>> d = { \"one\" : 1 , \"two\" : 2 , \"three\" : 3 , \"four\" : 4 } >>> d {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4} >>> list ( d ) ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four'] >>> list ( d . values ()) [1, 2, 3, 4] >>> d [ \"one\" ] = 42 >>> d {'one': 42, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4} >>> del d [ \"two\" ] >>> d [ \"two\" ] = None >>> d {'one': 42, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'two': None} Changed in version 3.7: Dictionary order is guaranteed to be insertion order. This behavior was an implementation detail of CPython from 3.6. These are the operations that dictionaries support (and therefore, custom mapping types should support too): list(d) Return a list of all the keys used in the dictionary d . len(d) Return the number of items in the dictionary d . d[key] Return the item of d with key key . Raises a KeyError if key is not in the map. If a subclass of dict defines a method __missing__() and key is not present, the d[key] operation calls that method with the key key as argument. The d[key] operation then returns or raises whatever is returned or raised by the __missing__(key) call. No other operations or methods invoke __missing__() . If __missing__() is not defined, KeyError is raised. __missing__() must be a method; it cannot be an instance variable: >>> class Counter ( dict ): ... def __missing__ ( self , key ): ... return 0 ... >>> c = Counter () >>> c [ 'red' ] 0 >>> c [ 'red' ] += 1 >>> c [ 'red' ] 1 The example above shows part of the implementation of collections.Counter . A different __missing__() method is used by collections.defaultdict . d[key] = value Set d[key] to value . del d[key] Remove d[key] from d . Raises a KeyError if key is not in the map. key in d Return True if d has a key key , else False . key not in d Equivalent to not key in d . iter(d) Return an iterator over the keys of the dictionary. This is a shortcut for iter(d.keys()) . clear ( ) Â¶ Remove all items from the dictionary. copy ( ) Â¶ Return a shallow copy of the dictionary. classmethod fromkeys ( iterable , value = None , / ) Â¶ Create a new dictionary with keys from iterable and values set to value . fromkeys() is a class method that returns a new dictionary. value defaults to None . All of the values refer to just a single instance, so it generally doesnât make sense for value to be a mutable object such as an empty list. To get distinct values, use a dict comprehension instead. get ( key , default = None , / ) Â¶ Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default . If default is not given, it defaults to None , so that this method never raises a KeyError . items ( ) Â¶ Return a new view of the dictionaryâs items ( (key, value) pairs). See the documentation of view objects . keys ( ) Â¶ Return a new view of the dictionaryâs keys. See the documentation of view objects . pop ( key , / ) Â¶ pop ( key , default , / ) If key is in the dictionary, remove it and return its value, else return default . If default is not given and key is not in the dictionary, a KeyError is raised. popitem ( ) Â¶ Remove and return a (key, value) pair from the dictionary. Pairs are returned in LIFO order. popitem() is useful to destructively iterate over a dictionary, as often used in set algorithms. If the dictionary is empty, calling popitem() raises a KeyError . Changed in version 3.7: LIFO order is now guaranteed. In prior versions, popitem() would return an arbitrary key/value pair. reversed(d) Return a reverse iterator over the keys of the dictionary. This is a shortcut for reversed(d.keys()) . Added in version 3.8. setdefault ( key , default = None , / ) Â¶ If key is in the dictionary, return its value. If not, insert key with a value of default and return default . default defaults to None . update ( ** kwargs ) Â¶ update ( mapping , / , ** kwargs ) update ( iterable , / , ** kwargs ) Update the dictionary with the key/value pairs from mapping or iterable and kwargs , overwriting existing keys. Return None . update() accepts either another object with a keys() method (in which case __getitem__() is called with every key returned from the method) or an iterable of key/value pairs (as tuples or other iterables of length two). If keyword arguments are specified, the dictionary is then updated with those key/value pairs: d.update(red=1, blue=2) . values ( ) Â¶ Return a new view of the dictionaryâs values. See the documentation of view objects . An equality comparison between one dict.values() view and another will always return False . This also applies when comparing dict.values() to itself: >>> d = { 'a' : 1 } >>> d . values () == d . values () False d | other Create a new dictionary with the merged keys and values of d and other , which must both be dictionaries. The values of other take priority when d and other share keys. Added in version 3.9. d |= other Update the dictionary d with keys and values from other , which may be either a mapping or an iterable of key/value pairs. The values of other take priority when d and other share keys. Added in version 3.9. Dictionaries and dictionary views are reversible. >>> d = { \"one\" : 1 , \"two\" : 2 , \"three\" : 3 , \"four\" : 4 } >>> d {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4} >>> list ( reversed ( d )) ['four', 'three', 'two', 'one'] >>> list ( reversed ( d . values ())) [4, 3, 2, 1] >>> list ( reversed ( d . items ())) [('four', 4), ('three', 3), ('two', 2), ('one', 1)] Changed in version 3.8: Dictionaries are now reversible. See also types.MappingProxyType can be used to create a read-only view of a dict . Thread safety for dict objects Creating a dictionary with the dict constructor is atomic when the argument to it is a dict or a tuple . When using the dict.fromkeys() method, dictionary creation is atomic when the argument is a dict , tuple , set or frozenset . The following operations and functions are lock-free and atomic . d [ key ] # dict.__getitem__ d . get ( key ) # dict.get key in d # dict.__contains__ len ( d ) # dict.__len__ All other operations from here on hold the per-object lock . Writing or removing a single item is safe to call from multiple threads and will not corrupt the dictionary: d [ key ] = value # write del d [ key ] # delete d . pop ( key ) # remove and return d . popitem () # remove and return last item d . setdefault ( key , v ) # insert if missing These operations may compare keys using __eq__() , which can execute arbitrary Python code. During such comparisons, the dictionary may be modified by another thread. For built-in types like str , int , and float , that implement __eq__() in C, the underlying lock is not released during comparisons and this is not a concern. The following operations return new objects and hold the per-object lock for the duration of the operation: d . copy () # returns a shallow copy of the dictionary d | other # merges two dicts into a new dict d . keys () # returns a new dict_keys view object d . values () # returns a new dict_values view object d . items () # returns a new dict_items view object The clear() method holds the lock for its duration. Other threads cannot observe elements being removed. The following operations lock both dictionaries. For update() and |= , this applies only when the other operand is a dict that uses the standard dict iterator (but not subclasses that override iteration). For equality comparison, this applies to dict and its subclasses: d . update ( other_dict ) # both locked when other_dict is a dict d |= other_dict # both locked when other_dict is a dict d == other_dict # both locked for dict and subclasses All comparison operations also compare values using __eq__() , so for non-built-in types the lock may be released during comparison. fromkeys() locks both the new dictionary and the iterable when the iterable is exactly a dict , set , or frozenset (not subclasses): dict . fromkeys ( a_dict ) # locks both dict . fromkeys ( a_set ) # locks both dict . fromkeys ( a_frozenset ) # locks both When updating from a non-dict iterable, only the target dictionary is locked. The iterable may be concurrently modified by another thread: d . update ( iterable ) # iterable is not a dict: only d locked d |= iterable # iterable is not a dict: only d locked dict . fromkeys ( iterable ) # iterable is not a dict/set/frozenset: only result locked Operations that involve multiple accesses, as well as iteration, are never atomic: # NOT atomic: read-modify-write d [ key ] = d [ key ] + 1 # NOT atomic: check-then-act (TOCTOU) if key in d : del d [ key ] # NOT thread-safe: iteration while modifying for key , value in d . items (): process ( key ) # another thread may modify d To avoid time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) issues, use atomic operations or handle exceptions: # Use pop() with default instead of check-then-delete d . pop ( key , None ) # Or handle the exception try : del d [ key ] except KeyError : pass To safely iterate over a dictionary that may be modified by another thread, iterate over a copy: # Make a copy to iterate safely for key , value in d . copy () . items (): process ( key ) Consider external synchronization when sharing dict instances across threads. See Python support for free threading for more information. Dictionary view objects Â¶ The objects returned by dict.keys() , dict.values() and dict.items() are view objects . They provide a dynamic view on the dictionaryâs entries, which means that when the dictionary changes, the view reflects these changes. Dictionary views can be iterated over to yield their respective data, and support membership tests: len(dictview) Return the number of entries in the dictionary. iter(dictview) Return an iterator over the keys, values or items (represented as tuples of (key, value) ) in the dictionary. Keys and values are iterated over in insertion order. This allows the creation of (value, key) pairs using zip() : pairs = zip(d.values(), d.keys()) . Another way to create the same list is pairs = [(v, k) for (k, v) in d.items()] . Iterating views while adding or deleting entries in the dictionary may raise a RuntimeError or fail to iterate over all entries. Changed in version 3.7: Dictionary order is guaranteed to be insertion order. x in dictview Return True if x is in the underlying dictionaryâs keys, values or items (in the latter case, x should be a (key, value) tuple). reversed(dictview) Return a reverse iterator over the keys, values or items of the dictionary. The view will be iterated in reverse order of the insertion. Changed in version 3.8: Dictionary views are now reversible. dictview.mapping Return a types.MappingProxyType that wraps the original dictionary to which the view refers. Added in version 3.10. Keys views are set-like since their entries are unique and hashable . Items views also have set-like operations since the (key, value) pairs are unique and the keys are hashable. If all values in an items view are hashable as well, then the items view can interoperate with other sets. (Values views are not treated as set-like since the entries are generally not unique.) For set-like views, all of the operations defined for the abstract base class collections.abc.Set are available (for example, == , < , or ^ ). While using set operators, set-like views accept any iterable as the other operand, unlike sets which only accept sets as the input. An example of dictionary view usage: >>> dishes = { 'eggs' : 2 , 'sausage' : 1 , 'bacon' : 1 , 'spam' : 500 } >>> keys = dishes . keys () >>> values = dishes . values () >>> # iteration >>> n = 0 >>> for val in values : ... n += val ... >>> print ( n ) 504 >>> # keys and values are iterated over in the same order (insertion order) >>> list ( keys ) ['eggs', 'sausage', 'bacon', 'spam'] >>> list ( values ) [2, 1, 1, 500] >>> # view objects are dynamic and reflect dict changes >>> del dishes [ 'eggs' ] >>> del dishes [ 'sausage' ] >>> list ( keys ) ['bacon', 'spam'] >>> # set operations >>> keys & { 'eggs' , 'bacon' , 'salad' } {'bacon'} >>> keys ^ { 'sausage' , 'juice' } == { 'juice' , 'sausage' , 'bacon' , 'spam' } True >>> keys | [ 'juice' , 'juice' , 'juice' ] == { 'bacon' , 'spam' , 'juice' } True >>> # get back a read-only proxy for the original dictionary >>> values . mapping mappingproxy({'bacon': 1, 'spam': 500}) >>> values . mapping [ 'spam' ] 500 Context Manager Types Â¶ Pythonâs with statement supports the concept of a runtime context defined by a context manager. This is implemented using a pair of methods that allow user-defined classes to define a runtime context that is entered before the statement body is executed and exited when the statement ends: contextmanager. __enter__ ( ) Â¶ Enter the runtime context and return either this object or another object related to the runtime context. The value returned by this method is bound to the identifier in the as clause of with statements using this context manager. An example of a context manager that returns itself is a file object . File objects return themselves from __enter__() to allow open() to be used as the context expression in a with statement. An example of a context manager that returns a related object is the one returned by decimal.localcontext() . These managers set the active decimal context to a copy of the original decimal context and then return the copy. This allows changes to be made to the current decimal context in the body of the with statement without affecting code outside the with statement. contextmanager. __exit__ ( exc_type , exc_val , exc_tb ) Â¶ Exit the runtime context and return a Boolean flag indicating if any exception that occurred should be suppressed. If an exception occurred while executing the body of the with statement, the arguments contain the exception type, value and traceback information. Otherwise, all three arguments are None . Returning a true value from this method will cause the with statement to suppress the exception and continue execution with the statement immediately following the with statement. Otherwise the exception continues propagating after this method has finished executing. If this method raises an exception while handling an earlier exception from the with block, the new exception is raised, and the original exception is stored in its __context__ attribute. The exception passed in should never be reraised explicitly - instead, this method should return a false value to indicate that the method completed successfully and does not want to suppress the raised exception. This allows context management code to easily detect whether or not an __exit__() method has actually failed. Python defines several context managers to support easy thread synchronisation, prompt closure of files or other objects, and simpler manipulation of the active decimal arithmetic context. The specific types are not treated specially beyond their implementation of the context management protocol. See the contextlib module for some examples. Pythonâs generator s and the contextlib.contextmanager decorator provide a convenient way to implement these protocols. If a generator function is decorated with the contextlib.contextmanager decorator, it will return a context manager implementing the necessary __enter__() and __exit__() methods, rather than the iterator produced by an undecorated generator function. Note that there is no specific slot for any of these methods in the type structure for Python objects in the Python/C API. Extension types wanting to define these methods must provide them as a normal Python accessible method. Compared to the overhead of setting up the runtime context, the overhead of a single class dictionary lookup is negligible. Type Annotation Types â Generic Alias , Union Â¶ The core built-in types for type annotations are Generic Alias and Union . Generic Alias Type Â¶ GenericAlias objects are generally created by subscripting a class. They are most often used with container classes , such as list or dict . For example, list[int] is a GenericAlias object created by subscripting the list class with the argument int . GenericAlias objects are intended primarily for use with type annotations . Note It is generally only possible to subscript a class if the class implements the special method __class_getitem__() . A GenericAlias object acts as a proxy for a generic type , implementing parameterized generics . For a container class, the argument(s) supplied to a subscription of the class may indicate the type(s) of the elements an object contains. For example, set[bytes] can be used in type annotations to signify a set in which all the elements are of type bytes . For a class which defines __class_getitem__() but is not a container, the argument(s) supplied to a subscription of the class will often indicate the return type(s) of one or more methods defined on an object. For example, regular expressions can be used on both the str data type and the bytes data type: If x = re.search('foo', 'foo') , x will be a re.Match object where the return values of x.group(0) and x[0] will both be of type str . We can represent this kind of object in type annotations with the GenericAlias re.Match[str] . If y = re.search(b'bar', b'bar') , (note the b for bytes ), y will also be an instance of re.Match , but the return values of y.group(0) and y[0] will both be of type bytes . In type annotations, we would represent this variety of re.Match objects with re.Match[bytes] . GenericAlias objects are instances of the class types.GenericAlias , which can also be used to create GenericAlias objects directly. T[X, Y, ...] Creates a GenericAlias representing a type T parameterized by types X , Y , and more depending on the T used. For example, a function expecting a list containing float elements: def average ( values : list [ float ]) -> float : return sum ( values ) / len ( values ) Another example for mapping objects, using a dict , which is a generic type expecting two type parameters representing the key type and the value type. In this example, the function expects a dict with keys of type str and values of type int : def send_post_request ( url : str , body : dict [ str , int ]) -> None : ... The builtin functions isinstance() and issubclass() do not accept GenericAlias types for their second argument: >>> isinstance ([ 1 , 2 ], list [ str ]) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 1 , in <module> TypeError : isinstance() argument 2 cannot be a parameterized generic The Python runtime does not enforce type annotations . This extends to generic types and their type parameters. When creating a container object from a GenericAlias , the elements in the container are not checked against their type. For example, the following code is discouraged, but will run without errors: >>> t = list [ str ] >>> t ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) [1, 2, 3] Furthermore, parameterized generics erase type parameters during object creation: >>> t = list [ str ] >>> type ( t ) <class 'types.GenericAlias'> >>> l = t () >>> type ( l ) <class 'list'> Calling repr() or str() on a generic shows the parameterized type: >>> repr ( list [ int ]) 'list[int]' >>> str ( list [ int ]) 'list[int]' The __getitem__() method of generic containers will raise an exception to disallow mistakes like dict[str][str] : >>> dict [ str ][ str ] Traceback (most recent call last): ... TypeError : dict[str] is not a generic class However, such expressions are valid when type variables are used. The index must have as many elements as there are type variable items in the GenericAlias objectâs __args__ . >>> from typing import TypeVar >>> Y = TypeVar ( 'Y' ) >>> dict [ str , Y ][ int ] dict[str, int] Standard Generic Classes Â¶ The following standard library classes support parameterized generics. This list is non-exhaustive. tuple list dict set frozenset type asyncio.Future asyncio.Task collections.deque collections.defaultdict collections.OrderedDict collections.Counter collections.ChainMap collections.abc.Awaitable collections.abc.Coroutine collections.abc.AsyncIterable collections.abc.AsyncIterator collections.abc.AsyncGenerator collections.abc.Iterable collections.abc.Iterator collections.abc.Generator collections.abc.Reversible collections.abc.Container collections.abc.Collection collections.abc.Callable collections.abc.Set collections.abc.MutableSet collections.abc.Mapping collections.abc.MutableMapping collections.abc.Sequence collections.abc.MutableSequence collections.abc.ByteString collections.abc.MappingView collections.abc.KeysView collections.abc.ItemsView collections.abc.ValuesView contextlib.AbstractContextManager contextlib.AbstractAsyncContextManager dataclasses.Field functools.cached_property functools.partialmethod os.PathLike queue.LifoQueue queue.Queue queue.PriorityQueue queue.SimpleQueue re.Pattern re.Match shelve.BsdDbShelf shelve.DbfilenameShelf shelve.Shelf types.MappingProxyType weakref.WeakKeyDictionary weakref.WeakMethod weakref.WeakSet weakref.WeakValueDictionary Special Attributes of GenericAlias objects Â¶ All parameterized generics implement special read-only attributes. genericalias. __origin__ Â¶ This attribute points at the non-parameterized generic class: >>> list [ int ] . __origin__ <class 'list'> genericalias. __args__ Â¶ This attribute is a tuple (possibly of length 1) of generic types passed to the original __class_getitem__() of the generic class: >>> dict [ str , list [ int ]] . __args__ (<class 'str'>, list[int]) genericalias. __parameters__ Â¶ This attribute is a lazily computed tuple (possibly empty) of unique type variables found in __args__ : >>> from typing import TypeVar >>> T = TypeVar ( 'T' ) >>> list [ T ] . __parameters__ (~T,) Note A GenericAlias object with typing.ParamSpec parameters may not have correct __parameters__ after substitution because typing.ParamSpec is intended primarily for static type checking. genericalias. __unpacked__ Â¶ A boolean that is true if the alias has been unpacked using the * operator (see TypeVarTuple ). Added in version 3.11. See also PEP 484 - Type Hints Introducing Pythonâs framework for type annotations. PEP 585 - Type Hinting Generics In Standard Collections Introducing the ability to natively parameterize standard-library classes, provided they implement the special class method __class_getitem__() . Generics , user-defined generics and typing.Generic Documentation on how to implement generic classes that can be parameterized at runtime and understood by static type-checkers. Added in version 3.9. Union Type Â¶ A union object holds the value of the | (bitwise or) operation on multiple type objects . These types are intended primarily for type annotations . The union type expression enables cleaner type hinting syntax compared to subscripting typing.Union . X | Y | ... Defines a union object which holds types X , Y , and so forth. X | Y means either X or Y. It is equivalent to typing.Union[X, Y] . For example, the following function expects an argument of type int or float : def square ( number : int | float ) -> int | float : return number ** 2 Note The | operand cannot be used at runtime to define unions where one or more members is a forward reference. For example, int | \"Foo\" , where \"Foo\" is a reference to a class not yet defined, will fail at runtime. For unions which include forward references, present the whole expression as a string, e.g. \"int | Foo\" . union_object == other Union objects can be tested for equality with other union objects. Details: Unions of unions are flattened: ( int | str ) | float == int | str | float Redundant types are removed: int | str | int == int | str When comparing unions, the order is ignored: int | str == str | int It creates instances of typing.Union : int | str == typing . Union [ int , str ] type ( int | str ) is typing . Union Optional types can be spelled as a union with None : str | None == typing . Optional [ str ] isinstance(obj, union_object) issubclass(obj, union_object) Calls to isinstance() and issubclass() are also supported with a union object: >>> isinstance ( \"\" , int | str ) True However, parameterized generics in union objects cannot be checked: >>> isinstance ( 1 , int | list [ int ]) # short-circuit evaluation True >>> isinstance ([ 1 ], int | list [ int ]) Traceback (most recent call last): ... TypeError : isinstance() argument 2 cannot be a parameterized generic The user-exposed type for the union object can be accessed from typing.Union and used for isinstance() checks: >>> import typing >>> isinstance ( int | str , typing . Union ) True >>> typing . Union () Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 1 , in <module> TypeError : cannot create 'typing.Union' instances Note The __or__() method for type objects was added to support the syntax X | Y . If a metaclass implements __or__() , the Union may override it: >>> class M ( type ): ... def __or__ ( self , other ): ... return \"Hello\" ... >>> class C ( metaclass = M ): ... pass ... >>> C | int 'Hello' >>> int | C int | C See also PEP 604 â PEP proposing the X | Y syntax and the Union type. Added in version 3.10. Changed in version 3.14: Union objects are now instances of typing.Union . Previously, they were instances of types.UnionType , which remains an alias for typing.Union . Other Built-in Types Â¶ The interpreter supports several other kinds of objects. Most of these support only one or two operations. Modules Â¶ The only special operation on a module is attribute access: m.name , where m is a module and name accesses a name defined in m âs symbol table. Module attributes can be assigned to. (Note that the import statement is not, strictly speaking, an operation on a module object; import foo does not require a module object named foo to exist, rather it requires an (external) definition for a module named foo somewhere.) A special attribute of every module is __dict__ . This is the dictionary containing the moduleâs symbol table. Modifying this dictionary will actually change the moduleâs symbol table, but direct assignment to the __dict__ attribute is not possible (you can write m.__dict__['a'] = 1 , which defines m.a to be 1 , but you canât write m.__dict__ = {} ). Modifying __dict__ directly is not recommended. Modules built into the interpreter are written like this: <module 'sys' (built-in)> . If loaded from a file, they are written as <module 'os' from '/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/os.pyc'> . Classes and Class Instances Â¶ See Objects, values and types and Class definitions for these. Functions Â¶ Function objects are created by function definitions. The only operation on a function object is to call it: func(argument-list) . There are really two flavors of function objects: built-in functions and user-defined functions. Both support the same operation (to call the function), but the implementation is different, hence the different object types. See Function definitions for more information. Methods Â¶ Methods are functions that are called using the attribute notation. There are two flavors: built-in methods (such as append() on lists) and class instance method . Built-in methods are described with the types that support them. If you access a method (a function defined in a class namespace) through an instance, you get a special object: a bound method (also called instance method ) object. When called, it will add the self argument to the argument list. Bound methods have two special read-only attributes: m.__self__ is the object on which the method operates, and m.__func__ is the function implementing the method. Calling m(arg-1, arg-2, ..., arg-n) is completely equivalent to calling m.__func__(m.__self__, arg-1, arg-2, ..., arg-n) . Like function objects , bound method objects support getting arbitrary attributes. However, since method attributes are actually stored on the underlying function object ( method.__func__ ), setting method attributes on bound methods is disallowed. Attempting to set an attribute on a method results in an AttributeError being raised. In order to set a method attribute, you need to explicitly set it on the underlying function object: >>> class C : ... def method ( self ): ... pass ... >>> c = C () >>> c . method . whoami = 'my name is method' # can't set on the method Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 1 , in <module> AttributeError : 'method' object has no attribute 'whoami' >>> c . method . __func__ . whoami = 'my name is method' >>> c . method . whoami 'my name is method' See Instance methods for more information. Code Objects Â¶ Code objects are used by the implementation to represent âpseudo-compiledâ executable Python code such as a function body. They differ from function objects because they donât contain a reference to their global execution environment. Code objects are returned by the built-in compile() function and can be extracted from function objects through their __code__ attribute. See also the code module. Accessing __code__ raises an auditing event object.__getattr__ with arguments obj and \"__code__\" . A code object can be executed or evaluated by passing it (instead of a source string) to the exec() or eval() built-in functions. See The standard type hierarchy for more information. Type Objects Â¶ Type objects represent the various object types. An objectâs type is accessed by the built-in function type() . There are no special operations on types. The standard module types defines names for all standard built-in types. Types are written like this: <class 'int'> . The Null Object Â¶ This object is returned by functions that donât explicitly return a value. It supports no special operations. There is exactly one null object, named None (a built-in name). type(None)() produces the same singleton. It is written as None . The Ellipsis Object Â¶ This object is commonly used to indicate that something is omitted. It supports no special operations. There is exactly one ellipsis object, named Ellipsis (a built-in name). type(Ellipsis)() produces the Ellipsis singleton. It is written as Ellipsis or ... . In typical use, ... as the Ellipsis object appears in a few different places, for instance: In type annotations, such as callable arguments or tuple elements . As the body of a function instead of a pass statement . In third-party libraries, such as Numpyâs slicing and striding . Python also uses three dots in ways that are not Ellipsis objects, for instance: Doctestâs ELLIPSIS , as a pattern for missing content. The default Python prompt of the interactive shell when partial input is incomplete. Lastly, the Python documentation often uses three dots in conventional English usage to mean omitted content, even in code examples that also use them as the Ellipsis . The NotImplemented Object Â¶ This object is returned from comparisons and binary operations when they are asked to operate on types they donât support. See Comparisons for more information. There is exactly one NotImplemented object. type(NotImplemented)() produces the singleton instance. It is written as NotImplemented . Internal Objects Â¶ See The standard type hierarchy for this information. It describes stack frame objects , traceback objects , and slice objects. Special Attributes Â¶ The implementation adds a few special read-only attributes to several object types, where they are relevant. Some of these are not reported by the dir() built-in function. definition. __name__ Â¶ The name of the class, function, method, descriptor, or generator instance. definition. __qualname__ Â¶ The qualified name of the class, function, method, descriptor, or generator instance. Added in version 3.3. definition. __module__ Â¶ The name of the module in which a class or function was defined. definition. __doc__ Â¶ The documentation string of a class or function, or None if undefined. definition. __type_params__ Â¶ The type parameters of generic classes, functions, and type aliases . For classes and functions that are not generic, this will be an empty tuple. Added in version 3.12. Integer string conversion length limitation Â¶ CPython has a global limit for converting between int and str to mitigate denial of service attacks. This limit only applies to decimal or other non-power-of-two number bases. Hexadecimal, octal, and binary conversions are unlimited. The limit can be configured. The int type in CPython is an arbitrary length number stored in binary form (commonly known as a âbignumâ). There exists no algorithm that can convert a string to a binary integer or a binary integer to a string in linear time, unless the base is a power of 2. Even the best known algorithms for base 10 have sub-quadratic complexity. Converting a large value such as int('1' * 500_000) can take over a second on a fast CPU. Limiting conversion size offers a practical way to avoid CVE 2020-10735 . The limit is applied to the number of digit characters in the input or output string when a non-linear conversion algorithm would be involved. Underscores and the sign are not counted towards the limit. When an operation would exceed the limit, a ValueError is raised: >>> import sys >>> sys . set_int_max_str_digits ( 4300 ) # Illustrative, this is the default. >>> _ = int ( '2' * 5432 ) Traceback (most recent call last): ... ValueError : Exceeds the limit (4300 digits) for integer string conversion: value has 5432 digits; use sys.set_int_max_str_digits() to increase the limit >>> i = int ( '2' * 4300 ) >>> len ( str ( i )) 4300 >>> i_squared = i * i >>> len ( str ( i_squared )) Traceback (most recent call last): ... ValueError : Exceeds the limit (4300 digits) for integer string conversion; use sys.set_int_max_str_digits() to increase the limit >>> len ( hex ( i_squared )) 7144 >>> assert int ( hex ( i_squared ), base = 16 ) == i * i # Hexadecimal is unlimited. The default limit is 4300 digits as provided in sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits . The lowest limit that can be configured is 640 digits as provided in sys.int_info.str_digits_check_threshold . Verification: >>> import sys >>> assert sys . int_info . default_max_str_digits == 4300 , sys . int_info >>> assert sys . int_info . str_digits_check_threshold == 640 , sys . int_info >>> msg = int ( '578966293710682886880994035146873798396722250538762761564' ... '9252925514383915483333812743580549779436104706260696366600' ... '571186405732' ) . to_bytes ( 53 , 'big' ) ... Added in version 3.11. Affected APIs Â¶ The limitation only applies to potentially slow conversions between int and str or bytes : int(string) with default base 10. int(string, base) for all bases that are not a power of 2. str(integer) . repr(integer) . any other string conversion to base 10, for example f\"{integer}\" , \"{}\".format(integer) , or b\"%d\" % integer . The limitations do not apply to functions with a linear algorithm: int(string, base) with base 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32. int.from_bytes() and int.to_bytes() . hex() , oct() , bin() . Format Specification Mini-Language for hex, octal, and binary numbers. str to float . str to decimal.Decimal . Configuring the limit Â¶ Before Python starts up you can use an environment variable or an interpreter command line flag to configure the limit: PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS , e.g. PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS=640 python3 to set the limit to 640 or PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS=0 python3 to disable the limitation. -X int_max_str_digits , e.g. python3 -X int_max_str_digits=640 sys.flags.int_max_str_digits contains the value of PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS or -X int_max_str_digits . If both the env var and the -X option are set, the -X option takes precedence. A value of -1 indicates that both were unset, thus a value of sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits was used during initialization. From code, you can inspect the current limit and set a new one using these sys APIs: sys.get_int_max_str_digits() and sys.set_int_max_str_digits() are a getter and setter for the interpreter-wide limit. Subinterpreters have their own limit. Information about the default and minimum can be found in sys.int_info : sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits is the compiled-in default limit. sys.int_info.str_digits_check_threshold is the lowest accepted value for the limit (other than 0 which disables it). Added in version 3.11. Caution Setting a low limit can lead to problems. While rare, code exists that contains integer constants in decimal in their source that exceed the minimum threshold. A consequence of setting the limit is that Python source code containing decimal integer literals longer than the limit will encounter an error during parsing, usually at startup time or import time or even at installation time - anytime an up to date .pyc does not already exist for the code. A workaround for source that contains such large constants is to convert them to 0x hexadecimal form as it has no limit. Test your application thoroughly if you use a low limit. Ensure your tests run with the limit set early via the environment or flag so that it applies during startup and even during any installation step that may invoke Python to precompile .py sources to .pyc files. Recommended configuration Â¶ The default sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits is expected to be reasonable for most applications. If your application requires a different limit, set it from your main entry point using Python version agnostic code as these APIs were added in security patch releases in versions before 3.12. Example: >>> import sys >>> if hasattr ( sys , \"set_int_max_str_digits\" ): ... upper_bound = 68000 ... lower_bound = 4004 ... current_limit = sys . get_int_max_str_digits () ... if current_limit == 0 or current_limit > upper_bound : ... sys . set_int_max_str_digits ( upper_bound ) ... elif current_limit < lower_bound : ... sys . set_int_max_str_digits ( lower_bound ) If you need to disable it entirely, set it to 0 .

      "text_content": "Built-in Exceptions Â¶ In Python, all exceptions must be instances of a class that derives from BaseException . In a try statement with an except clause that mentions a particular class, that clause also handles any exception classes derived from that class (but not exception classes from which it is derived). Two exception classes that are not related via subclassing are never equivalent, even if they have the same name. The built-in exceptions listed in this chapter can be generated by the interpreter or built-in functions. Except where mentioned, they have an âassociated valueâ indicating the detailed cause of the error. This may be a string or a tuple of several items of information (e.g., an error code and a string explaining the code). The associated value is usually passed as arguments to the exception classâs constructor. User code can raise built-in exceptions. This can be used to test an exception handler or to report an error condition âjust likeâ the situation in which the interpreter raises the same exception; but beware that there is nothing to prevent user code from raising an inappropriate error. The built-in exception classes can be subclassed to define new exceptions; programmers are encouraged to derive new exceptions from the Exception class or one of its subclasses, and not from BaseException . More information on defining exceptions is available in the Python Tutorial under User-defined Exceptions . Exception context Â¶ Three attributes on exception objects provide information about the context in which the exception was raised: BaseException. __context__ Â¶ BaseException. __cause__ Â¶ BaseException. __suppress_context__ Â¶ When raising a new exception while another exception is already being handled, the new exceptionâs __context__ attribute is automatically set to the handled exception. An exception may be handled when an except or finally clause, or a with statement, is used. This implicit exception context can be supplemented with an explicit cause by using from with raise : raise new_exc from original_exc The expression following from must be an exception or None . It will be set as __cause__ on the raised exception. Setting __cause__ also implicitly sets the __suppress_context__ attribute to True , so that using raise new_exc from None effectively replaces the old exception with the new one for display purposes (e.g. converting KeyError to AttributeError ), while leaving the old exception available in __context__ for introspection when debugging. The default traceback display code shows these chained exceptions in addition to the traceback for the exception itself. An explicitly chained exception in __cause__ is always shown when present. An implicitly chained exception in __context__ is shown only if __cause__ is None and __suppress_context__ is false. In either case, the exception itself is always shown after any chained exceptions so that the final line of the traceback always shows the last exception that was raised. Inheriting from built-in exceptions Â¶ User code can create subclasses that inherit from an exception type. Itâs recommended to only subclass one exception type at a time to avoid any possible conflicts between how the bases handle the args attribute, as well as due to possible memory layout incompatibilities. CPython implementation detail: Most built-in exceptions are implemented in C for efficiency, see: Objects/exceptions.c . Some have custom memory layouts which makes it impossible to create a subclass that inherits from multiple exception types. The memory layout of a type is an implementation detail and might change between Python versions, leading to new conflicts in the future. Therefore, itâs recommended to avoid subclassing multiple exception types altogether. Base classes Â¶ The following exceptions are used mostly as base classes for other exceptions. exception BaseException Â¶ The base class for all built-in exceptions. It is not meant to be directly inherited by user-defined classes (for that, use Exception ). If str() is called on an instance of this class, the representation of the argument(s) to the instance are returned, or the empty string when there were no arguments. args Â¶ The tuple of arguments given to the exception constructor. Some built-in exceptions (like OSError ) expect a certain number of arguments and assign a special meaning to the elements of this tuple, while others are usually called only with a single string giving an error message. with_traceback ( tb ) Â¶ This method sets tb as the new traceback for the exception and returns the exception object. It was more commonly used before the exception chaining features of PEP 3134 became available. The following example shows how we can convert an instance of SomeException into an instance of OtherException while preserving the traceback. Once raised, the current frame is pushed onto the traceback of the OtherException , as would have happened to the traceback of the original SomeException had we allowed it to propagate to the caller. try : ... except SomeException : tb = sys . exception () . __traceback__ raise OtherException ( ... ) . with_traceback ( tb ) __traceback__ Â¶ A writable field that holds the traceback object associated with this exception. See also: The raise statement . add_note ( note ) Â¶ Add the string note to the exceptionâs notes which appear in the standard traceback after the exception string. A TypeError is raised if note is not a string. Added in version 3.11. __notes__ Â¶ A list of the notes of this exception, which were added with add_note() . This attribute is created when add_note() is called. Added in version 3.11. exception Exception Â¶ All built-in, non-system-exiting exceptions are derived from this class. All user-defined exceptions should also be derived from this class. exception ArithmeticError Â¶ The base class for those built-in exceptions that are raised for various arithmetic errors: OverflowError , ZeroDivisionError , FloatingPointError . exception BufferError Â¶ Raised when a buffer related operation cannot be performed. exception LookupError Â¶ The base class for the exceptions that are raised when a key or index used on a mapping or sequence is invalid: IndexError , KeyError . This can be raised directly by codecs.lookup() . Concrete exceptions Â¶ The following exceptions are the exceptions that are usually raised. exception AssertionError Â¶ Raised when an assert statement fails. exception AttributeError Â¶ Raised when an attribute reference (see Attribute references ) or assignment fails. (When an object does not support attribute references or attribute assignments at all, TypeError is raised.) The optional name and obj keyword-only arguments set the corresponding attributes: name Â¶ The name of the attribute that was attempted to be accessed. obj Â¶ The object that was accessed for the named attribute. Changed in version 3.10: Added the name and obj attributes. exception EOFError Â¶ Raised when the input() function hits an end-of-file condition (EOF) without reading any data. (Note: the io.IOBase.read() and io.IOBase.readline() methods return an empty string when they hit EOF.) exception FloatingPointError Â¶ Not currently used. exception GeneratorExit Â¶ Raised when a generator or coroutine is closed; see generator.close() and coroutine.close() . It directly inherits from BaseException instead of Exception since it is technically not an error. exception ImportError Â¶ Raised when the import statement has troubles trying to load a module. Also raised when the âfrom listâ in from ... import has a name that cannot be found. The optional name and path keyword-only arguments set the corresponding attributes: name Â¶ The name of the module that was attempted to be imported. path Â¶ The path to any file which triggered the exception. Changed in version 3.3: Added the name and path attributes. exception ModuleNotFoundError Â¶ A subclass of ImportError which is raised by import when a module could not be located. It is also raised when None is found in sys.modules . Added in version 3.6. exception IndexError Â¶ Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range. (Slice indices are silently truncated to fall in the allowed range; if an index is not an integer, TypeError is raised.) exception KeyError Â¶ Raised when a mapping (dictionary) key is not found in the set of existing keys. exception KeyboardInterrupt Â¶ Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (normally Control - C or Delete ). During execution, a check for interrupts is made regularly. The exception inherits from BaseException so as to not be accidentally caught by code that catches Exception and thus prevent the interpreter from exiting. Note Catching a KeyboardInterrupt requires special consideration. Because it can be raised at unpredictable points, it may, in some circumstances, leave the running program in an inconsistent state. It is generally best to allow KeyboardInterrupt to end the program as quickly as possible or avoid raising it entirely. (See Note on Signal Handlers and Exceptions .) exception MemoryError Â¶ Raised when an operation runs out of memory but the situation may still be rescued (by deleting some objects). The associated value is a string indicating what kind of (internal) operation ran out of memory. Note that because of the underlying memory management architecture (Câs malloc() function), the interpreter may not always be able to completely recover from this situation; it nevertheless raises an exception so that a stack traceback can be printed, in case a run-away program was the cause. exception NameError Â¶ Raised when a local or global name is not found. This applies only to unqualified names. The associated value is an error message that includes the name that could not be found. The optional name keyword-only argument sets the attribute: name Â¶ The name of the variable that was attempted to be accessed. Changed in version 3.10: Added the name attribute. exception NotImplementedError Â¶ This exception is derived from RuntimeError . In user defined base classes, abstract methods should raise this exception when they require derived classes to override the method, or while the class is being developed to indicate that the real implementation still needs to be added. Note It should not be used to indicate that an operator or method is not meant to be supported at all â in that case either leave the operator / method undefined or, if a subclass, set it to None . Caution NotImplementedError and NotImplemented are not interchangeable. This exception should only be used as described above; see NotImplemented for details on correct usage of the built-in constant. exception OSError ( [ arg ] ) Â¶ exception OSError ( errno , strerror [ , filename [ , winerror [ , filename2 ] ] ] ) This exception is raised when a system function returns a system-related error, including I/O failures such as âfile not foundâ or âdisk fullâ (not for illegal argument types or other incidental errors). The second form of the constructor sets the corresponding attributes, described below. The attributes default to None if not specified. For backwards compatibility, if three arguments are passed, the args attribute contains only a 2-tuple of the first two constructor arguments. The constructor often actually returns a subclass of OSError , as described in OS exceptions below. The particular subclass depends on the final errno value. This behaviour only occurs when constructing OSError directly or via an alias, and is not inherited when subclassing. errno Â¶ A numeric error code from the C variable errno . winerror Â¶ Under Windows, this gives you the native Windows error code. The errno attribute is then an approximate translation, in POSIX terms, of that native error code. Under Windows, if the winerror constructor argument is an integer, the errno attribute is determined from the Windows error code, and the errno argument is ignored. On other platforms, the winerror argument is ignored, and the winerror attribute does not exist. strerror Â¶ The corresponding error message, as provided by the operating system. It is formatted by the C functions perror() under POSIX, and FormatMessage() under Windows. filename Â¶ filename2 Â¶ For exceptions that involve a file system path (such as open() or os.unlink() ), filename is the file name passed to the function. For functions that involve two file system paths (such as os.rename() ), filename2 corresponds to the second file name passed to the function. Changed in version 3.3: EnvironmentError , IOError , WindowsError , socket.error , select.error and mmap.error have been merged into OSError , and the constructor may return a subclass. Changed in version 3.4: The filename attribute is now the original file name passed to the function, instead of the name encoded to or decoded from the filesystem encoding and error handler . Also, the filename2 constructor argument and attribute was added. exception OverflowError Â¶ Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented. This cannot occur for integers (which would rather raise MemoryError than give up). However, for historical reasons, OverflowError is sometimes raised for integers that are outside a required range. Because of the lack of standardization of floating-point exception handling in C, most floating-point operations are not checked. exception PythonFinalizationError Â¶ This exception is derived from RuntimeError . It is raised when an operation is blocked during interpreter shutdown also known as Python finalization . Examples of operations which can be blocked with a PythonFinalizationError during the Python finalization: Creating a new Python thread. Joining a running daemon thread. os.fork() . See also the sys.is_finalizing() function. Added in version 3.13: Previously, a plain RuntimeError was raised. Changed in version 3.14: threading.Thread.join() can now raise this exception. exception RecursionError Â¶ This exception is derived from RuntimeError . It is raised when the interpreter detects that the maximum recursion depth (see sys.getrecursionlimit() ) is exceeded. Added in version 3.5: Previously, a plain RuntimeError was raised. exception ReferenceError Â¶ This exception is raised when a weak reference proxy, created by the weakref.proxy() function, is used to access an attribute of the referent after it has been garbage collected. For more information on weak references, see the weakref module. exception RuntimeError Â¶ Raised when an error is detected that doesnât fall in any of the other categories. The associated value is a string indicating what precisely went wrong. exception StopIteration Â¶ Raised by built-in function next() and an iterator 's __next__() method to signal that there are no further items produced by the iterator. value Â¶ The exception object has a single attribute value , which is given as an argument when constructing the exception, and defaults to None . When a generator or coroutine function returns, a new StopIteration instance is raised, and the value returned by the function is used as the value parameter to the constructor of the exception. If a generator code directly or indirectly raises StopIteration , it is converted into a RuntimeError (retaining the StopIteration as the new exceptionâs cause). Changed in version 3.3: Added value attribute and the ability for generator functions to use it to return a value. Changed in version 3.5: Introduced the RuntimeError transformation via from __future__ import generator_stop , see PEP 479 . Changed in version 3.7: Enable PEP 479 for all code by default: a StopIteration error raised in a generator is transformed into a RuntimeError . exception StopAsyncIteration Â¶ Must be raised by __anext__() method of an asynchronous iterator object to stop the iteration. Added in version 3.5. exception SyntaxError ( message , details ) Â¶ Raised when the parser encounters a syntax error. This may occur in an import statement, in a call to the built-in functions compile() , exec() , or eval() , or when reading the initial script or standard input (also interactively). The str() of the exception instance returns only the error message. Details is a tuple whose members are also available as separate attributes. filename Â¶ The name of the file the syntax error occurred in. lineno Â¶ Which line number in the file the error occurred in. This is 1-indexed: the first line in the file has a lineno of 1. offset Â¶ The column in the line where the error occurred. This is 1-indexed: the first character in the line has an offset of 1. text Â¶ The source code text involved in the error. end_lineno Â¶ Which line number in the file the error occurred ends in. This is 1-indexed: the first line in the file has a lineno of 1. end_offset Â¶ The column in the end line where the error occurred finishes. This is 1-indexed: the first character in the line has an offset of 1. For errors in f-string fields, the message is prefixed by âf-string: â and the offsets are offsets in a text constructed from the replacement expression. For example, compiling fâBad {a b} fieldâ results in this args attribute: (âf-string: â¦â, (ââ, 1, 2, â(a b)nâ, 1, 5)). Changed in version 3.10: Added the end_lineno and end_offset attributes. exception IndentationError Â¶ Base class for syntax errors related to incorrect indentation. This is a subclass of SyntaxError . exception TabError Â¶ Raised when indentation contains an inconsistent use of tabs and spaces. This is a subclass of IndentationError . exception SystemError Â¶ Raised when the interpreter finds an internal error, but the situation does not look so serious to cause it to abandon all hope. The associated value is a string indicating what went wrong (in low-level terms). In CPython , this could be raised by incorrectly using Pythonâs C API, such as returning a NULL value without an exception set. If youâre confident that this exception wasnât your fault, or the fault of a package youâre using, you should report this to the author or maintainer of your Python interpreter. Be sure to report the version of the Python interpreter ( sys.version ; it is also printed at the start of an interactive Python session), the exact error message (the exceptionâs associated value) and if possible the source of the program that triggered the error. exception SystemExit Â¶ This exception is raised by the sys.exit() function. It inherits from BaseException instead of Exception so that it is not accidentally caught by code that catches Exception . This allows the exception to properly propagate up and cause the interpreter to exit. When it is not handled, the Python interpreter exits; no stack traceback is printed. The constructor accepts the same optional argument passed to sys.exit() . If the value is an integer, it specifies the system exit status (passed to Câs exit() function); if it is None , the exit status is zero; if it has another type (such as a string), the objectâs value is printed and the exit status is one. A call to sys.exit() is translated into an exception so that clean-up handlers ( finally clauses of try statements) can be executed, and so that a debugger can execute a script without running the risk of losing control. The os._exit() function can be used if it is absolutely positively necessary to exit immediately (for example, in the child process after a call to os.fork() ). code Â¶ The exit status or error message that is passed to the constructor. (Defaults to None .) exception TypeError Â¶ Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type. The associated value is a string giving details about the type mismatch. This exception may be raised by user code to indicate that an attempted operation on an object is not supported, and is not meant to be. If an object is meant to support a given operation but has not yet provided an implementation, NotImplementedError is the proper exception to raise. Passing arguments of the wrong type (e.g. passing a list when an int is expected) should result in a TypeError , but passing arguments with the wrong value (e.g. a number outside expected boundaries) should result in a ValueError . exception UnboundLocalError Â¶ Raised when a reference is made to a local variable in a function or method, but no value has been bound to that variable. This is a subclass of NameError . exception UnicodeError Â¶ Raised when a Unicode-related encoding or decoding error occurs. It is a subclass of ValueError . UnicodeError has attributes that describe the encoding or decoding error. For example, err.object[err.start:err.end] gives the particular invalid input that the codec failed on. encoding Â¶ The name of the encoding that raised the error. reason Â¶ A string describing the specific codec error. object Â¶ The object the codec was attempting to encode or decode. start Â¶ The first index of invalid data in object . This value should not be negative as it is interpreted as an absolute offset but this constraint is not enforced at runtime. end Â¶ The index after the last invalid data in object . This value should not be negative as it is interpreted as an absolute offset but this constraint is not enforced at runtime. exception UnicodeEncodeError Â¶ Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during encoding. It is a subclass of UnicodeError . exception UnicodeDecodeError Â¶ Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during decoding. It is a subclass of UnicodeError . exception UnicodeTranslateError Â¶ Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during translating. It is a subclass of UnicodeError . exception ValueError Â¶ Raised when an operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value, and the situation is not described by a more precise exception such as IndexError . exception ZeroDivisionError Â¶ Raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero. The associated value is a string indicating the type of the operands and the operation. The following exceptions are kept for compatibility with previous versions; starting from Python 3.3, they are aliases of OSError . exception EnvironmentError Â¶ exception IOError Â¶ exception WindowsError Â¶ Only available on Windows. OS exceptions Â¶ The following exceptions are subclasses of OSError , they get raised depending on the system error code. exception BlockingIOError Â¶ Raised when an operation would block on an object (e.g. socket) set for non-blocking operation. Corresponds to errno EAGAIN , EALREADY , EWOULDBLOCK and EINPROGRESS . In addition to those of OSError , BlockingIOError can have one more attribute: characters_written Â¶ An integer containing the number of bytes written to the stream before it blocked. This attribute is available when using the buffered I/O classes from the io module. exception ChildProcessError Â¶ Raised when an operation on a child process failed. Corresponds to errno ECHILD . exception ConnectionError Â¶ A base class for connection-related issues. Subclasses are BrokenPipeError , ConnectionAbortedError , ConnectionRefusedError and ConnectionResetError . exception BrokenPipeError Â¶ A subclass of ConnectionError , raised when trying to write on a pipe while the other end has been closed, or trying to write on a socket which has been shutdown for writing. Corresponds to errno EPIPE and ESHUTDOWN . exception ConnectionAbortedError Â¶ A subclass of ConnectionError , raised when a connection attempt is aborted by the peer. Corresponds to errno ECONNABORTED . exception ConnectionRefusedError Â¶ A subclass of ConnectionError , raised when a connection attempt is refused by the peer. Corresponds to errno ECONNREFUSED . exception ConnectionResetError Â¶ A subclass of ConnectionError , raised when a connection is reset by the peer. Corresponds to errno ECONNRESET . exception FileExistsError Â¶ Raised when trying to create a file or directory which already exists. Corresponds to errno EEXIST . exception FileNotFoundError Â¶ Raised when a file or directory is requested but doesnât exist. Corresponds to errno ENOENT . exception InterruptedError Â¶ Raised when a system call is interrupted by an incoming signal. Corresponds to errno EINTR . Changed in version 3.5: Python now retries system calls when a syscall is interrupted by a signal, except if the signal handler raises an exception (see PEP 475 for the rationale), instead of raising InterruptedError . exception IsADirectoryError Â¶ Raised when a file operation (such as os.remove() ) is requested on a directory. Corresponds to errno EISDIR . exception NotADirectoryError Â¶ Raised when a directory operation (such as os.listdir() ) is requested on something which is not a directory. On most POSIX platforms, it may also be raised if an operation attempts to open or traverse a non-directory file as if it were a directory. Corresponds to errno ENOTDIR . exception PermissionError Â¶ Raised when trying to run an operation without the adequate access rights - for example filesystem permissions. Corresponds to errno EACCES , EPERM , and ENOTCAPABLE . Changed in version 3.11.1: WASIâs ENOTCAPABLE is now mapped to PermissionError . exception ProcessLookupError Â¶ Raised when a given process doesnât exist. Corresponds to errno ESRCH . exception TimeoutError Â¶ Raised when a system function timed out at the system level. Corresponds to errno ETIMEDOUT . Added in version 3.3: All the above OSError subclasses were added. See also PEP 3151 - Reworking the OS and IO exception hierarchy Warnings Â¶ The following exceptions are used as warning categories; see the Warning Categories documentation for more details. exception Warning Â¶ Base class for warning categories. exception UserWarning Â¶ Base class for warnings generated by user code. exception DeprecationWarning Â¶ Base class for warnings about deprecated features when those warnings are intended for other Python developers. Ignored by the default warning filters, except in the __main__ module ( PEP 565 ). Enabling the Python Development Mode shows this warning. The deprecation policy is described in PEP 387 . exception PendingDeprecationWarning Â¶ Base class for warnings about features which are obsolete and expected to be deprecated in the future, but are not deprecated at the moment. This class is rarely used as emitting a warning about a possible upcoming deprecation is unusual, and DeprecationWarning is preferred for already active deprecations. Ignored by the default warning filters. Enabling the Python Development Mode shows this warning. The deprecation policy is described in PEP 387 . exception SyntaxWarning Â¶ Base class for warnings about dubious syntax. This warning is typically emitted when compiling Python source code, and usually wonât be reported when running already compiled code. exception RuntimeWarning Â¶ Base class for warnings about dubious runtime behavior. exception FutureWarning Â¶ Base class for warnings about deprecated features when those warnings are intended for end users of applications that are written in Python. exception ImportWarning Â¶ Base class for warnings about probable mistakes in module imports. Ignored by the default warning filters. Enabling the Python Development Mode shows this warning. exception UnicodeWarning Â¶ Base class for warnings related to Unicode. exception EncodingWarning Â¶ Base class for warnings related to encodings. See Opt-in EncodingWarning for details. Added in version 3.10. exception BytesWarning Â¶ Base class for warnings related to bytes and bytearray . exception ResourceWarning Â¶ Base class for warnings related to resource usage. Ignored by the default warning filters. Enabling the Python Development Mode shows this warning. Added in version 3.2. Exception groups Â¶ The following are used when it is necessary to raise multiple unrelated exceptions. They are part of the exception hierarchy so they can be handled with except like all other exceptions. In addition, they are recognised by except* , which matches their subgroups based on the types of the contained exceptions. exception ExceptionGroup ( msg , excs ) Â¶ exception BaseExceptionGroup ( msg , excs ) Â¶ Both of these exception types wrap the exceptions in the sequence excs . The msg parameter must be a string. The difference between the two classes is that BaseExceptionGroup extends BaseException and it can wrap any exception, while ExceptionGroup extends Exception and it can only wrap subclasses of Exception . This design is so that except Exception catches an ExceptionGroup but not BaseExceptionGroup . The BaseExceptionGroup constructor returns an ExceptionGroup rather than a BaseExceptionGroup if all contained exceptions are Exception instances, so it can be used to make the selection automatic. The ExceptionGroup constructor, on the other hand, raises a TypeError if any contained exception is not an Exception subclass. message Â¶ The msg argument to the constructor. This is a read-only attribute. exceptions Â¶ A tuple of the exceptions in the excs sequence given to the constructor. This is a read-only attribute. subgroup ( condition ) Â¶ Returns an exception group that contains only the exceptions from the current group that match condition , or None if the result is empty. The condition can be an exception type or tuple of exception types, in which case each exception is checked for a match using the same check that is used in an except clause. The condition can also be a callable (other than a type object) that accepts an exception as its single argument and returns true for the exceptions that should be in the subgroup. The nesting structure of the current exception is preserved in the result, as are the values of its message , __traceback__ , __cause__ , __context__ and __notes__ fields. Empty nested groups are omitted from the result. The condition is checked for all exceptions in the nested exception group, including the top-level and any nested exception groups. If the condition is true for such an exception group, it is included in the result in full. Added in version 3.13: condition can be any callable which is not a type object. split ( condition ) Â¶ Like subgroup() , but returns the pair (match, rest) where match is subgroup(condition) and rest is the remaining non-matching part. derive ( excs ) Â¶ Returns an exception group with the same message , but which wraps the exceptions in excs . This method is used by subgroup() and split() , which are used in various contexts to break up an exception group. A subclass needs to override it in order to make subgroup() and split() return instances of the subclass rather than ExceptionGroup . subgroup() and split() copy the __traceback__ , __cause__ , __context__ and __notes__ fields from the original exception group to the one returned by derive() , so these fields do not need to be updated by derive() . >>> class MyGroup ( ExceptionGroup ): ... def derive ( self , excs ): ... return MyGroup ( self . message , excs ) ... >>> e = MyGroup ( \"eg\" , [ ValueError ( 1 ), TypeError ( 2 )]) >>> e . add_note ( \"a note\" ) >>> e . __context__ = Exception ( \"context\" ) >>> e . __cause__ = Exception ( \"cause\" ) >>> try : ... raise e ... except Exception as e : ... exc = e ... >>> match , rest = exc . split ( ValueError ) >>> exc , exc . __context__ , exc . __cause__ , exc . __notes__ (MyGroup('eg', [ValueError(1), TypeError(2)]), Exception('context'), Exception('cause'), ['a note']) >>> match , match . __context__ , match . __cause__ , match . __notes__ (MyGroup('eg', [ValueError(1)]), Exception('context'), Exception('cause'), ['a note']) >>> rest , rest . __context__ , rest . __cause__ , rest . __notes__ (MyGroup('eg', [TypeError(2)]), Exception('context'), Exception('cause'), ['a note']) >>> exc . __traceback__ is match . __traceback__ is rest . __traceback__ True Note that BaseExceptionGroup defines __new__() , so subclasses that need a different constructor signature need to override that rather than __init__() . For example, the following defines an exception group subclass which accepts an exit_code and constructs the groupâs message from it. class Errors ( ExceptionGroup ): def __new__ ( cls , errors , exit_code ): self = super () . __new__ ( Errors , f \"exit code: { exit_code } \" , errors ) self . exit_code = exit_code return self def derive ( self , excs ): return Errors ( excs , self . exit_code ) Like ExceptionGroup , any subclass of BaseExceptionGroup which is also a subclass of Exception can only wrap instances of Exception . Added in version 3.11.

In particular, string.printable is not printable in the POSIX sense (see LC_CTYPE ). string. whitespace Â¶ A string containing all ASCII characters that are considered whitespace. This includes the characters space, tab, linefeed, return, formfeed, and vertical tab. Custom String Formatting Â¶ The built-in string class provides the ability to do complex variable substitutions and value formatting via the format() method described in PEP 3101 . The Formatter class in the string module allows you to create and customize your own string formatting behaviors using the same implementation as the built-in format() method. class string. Formatter Â¶ The Formatter class has the following public methods: format ( format_string , / , * args , ** kwargs ) Â¶ The primary API method. It takes a format string and an arbitrary set of positional and keyword arguments. It is just a wrapper that calls vformat() . Changed in version 3.7: A format string argument is now positional-only . vformat ( format_string , args , kwargs ) Â¶ This function does the actual work of formatting. It is exposed as a separate function for cases where you want to pass in a predefined dictionary of arguments, rather than unpacking and repacking the dictionary as individual arguments using the *args and **kwargs syntax. vformat() does the work of breaking up the format string into character data and replacement fields. It calls the various methods described below. In addition, the Formatter defines a number of methods that are intended to be replaced by subclasses: parse ( format_string ) Â¶ Loop over the format_string and return an iterable of tuples ( literal_text , field_name , format_spec , conversion ). This is used by vformat() to break the string into either literal text, or replacement fields. The values in the tuple conceptually represent a span of literal text followed by a single replacement field. If there is no literal text (which can happen if two replacement fields occur consecutively), then literal_text will be a zero-length string. If there is no replacement field, then the values of field_name , format_spec and conversion will be None . The value of field_name is unmodified and auto-numbering of non-numbered positional fields is done by vformat() . get_field ( field_name , args , kwargs ) Â¶ Given field_name , convert it to an object to be formatted. Auto-numbering of field_name returned from parse() is done by vformat() before calling this method. Returns a tuple (obj, used_key). The default version takes strings of the form defined in PEP 3101 , such as â0[name]â or âlabel.titleâ. args and kwargs are as passed in to vformat() . The return value used_key has the same meaning as the key parameter to get_value() . get_value ( key , args , kwargs ) Â¶ Retrieve a given field value. The key argument will be either an integer or a string. If it is an integer, it represents the index of the positional argument in args ; if it is a string, then it represents a named argument in kwargs . The args parameter is set to the list of positional arguments to vformat() , and the kwargs parameter is set to the dictionary of keyword arguments. For compound field names, these functions are only called for the first component of the field name; subsequent components are handled through normal attribute and indexing operations. So for example, the field expression â0.nameâ would cause get_value() to be called with a key argument of 0. The name attribute will be looked up after get_value() returns by calling the built-in getattr() function. If the index or keyword refers to an item that does not exist, then an IndexError or KeyError should be raised. check_unused_args ( used_args , args , kwargs ) Â¶ Implement checking for unused arguments if desired. The arguments to this function is the set of all argument keys that were actually referred to in the format string (integers for positional arguments, and strings for named arguments), and a reference to the args and kwargs that was passed to vformat. The set of unused args can be calculated from these parameters. check_unused_args() is assumed to raise an exception if the check fails. format_field ( value , format_spec ) Â¶ format_field() simply calls the global format() built-in. The method is provided so that subclasses can override it. convert_field ( value , conversion ) Â¶ Converts the value (returned by get_field() ) given a conversion type (as in the tuple returned by the parse() method). The default version understands âsâ (str), ârâ (repr) and âaâ (ascii) conversion types. Format String Syntax Â¶ The str.format() method and the Formatter class share the same syntax for format strings (although in the case of Formatter , subclasses can define their own format string syntax). The syntax is related to that of formatted string literals and template string literals , but it is less sophisticated and, in particular, does not support arbitrary expressions in interpolations. Format strings contain âreplacement fieldsâ surrounded by curly braces {} . Anything that is not contained in braces is considered literal text, which is copied unchanged to the output. If you need to include a brace character in the literal text, it can be escaped by doubling: {{ and }} . The grammar for a replacement field is as follows: replacement_field : \"{\" [ field_name ] [ \"!\" conversion ] [ \":\" format_spec ] \"}\" field_name : arg_name ( \".\" attribute_name | \"[\" element_index \"]\" )* arg_name : [ identifier | digit +] attribute_name : identifier element_index : digit + | index_string index_string : <any source character except \"]\" > + conversion : \"r\" | \"s\" | \"a\" format_spec : format-spec:format_spec In less formal terms, the replacement field can start with a field_name that specifies the object whose value is to be formatted and inserted into the output instead of the replacement field. The field_name is optionally followed by a conversion field, which is preceded by an exclamation point '!' , and a format_spec , which is preceded by a colon ':' . These specify a non-default format for the replacement value. See also the Format Specification Mini-Language section. The field_name itself begins with an arg_name that is either a number or a keyword. If itâs a number, it refers to a positional argument, and if itâs a keyword, it refers to a named keyword argument. An arg_name is treated as a number if a call to str.isdecimal() on the string would return true. If the numerical arg_names in a format string are 0, 1, 2, â¦ in sequence, they can all be omitted (not just some) and the numbers 0, 1, 2, â¦ will be automatically inserted in that order. Because arg_name is not quote-delimited, it is not possible to specify arbitrary dictionary keys (e.g., the strings '10' or ':-]' ) within a format string. The arg_name can be followed by any number of index or attribute expressions. An expression of the form '.name' selects the named attribute using getattr() , while an expression of the form '[index]' does an index lookup using __getitem__() . Changed in version 3.1: The positional argument specifiers can be omitted for str.format() , so '{} {}'.format(a, b) is equivalent to '{0} {1}'.format(a, b) . Changed in version 3.4: The positional argument specifiers can be omitted for Formatter . Some simple format string examples: \"First, thou shalt count to {0} \" # References first positional argument \"Bring me a {} \" # Implicitly references the first positional argument \"From {} to {} \" # Same as \"From {0} to {1}\" \"My quest is {name} \" # References keyword argument 'name' \"Weight in tons {0.weight} \" # 'weight' attribute of first positional arg \"Units destroyed: {players[0]} \" # First element of keyword argument 'players'. The conversion field causes a type coercion before formatting. Normally, the job of formatting a value is done by the __format__() method of the value itself. However, in some cases it is desirable to force a type to be formatted as a string, overriding its own definition of formatting. By converting the value to a string before calling __format__() , the normal formatting logic is bypassed. Three conversion flags are currently supported: '!s' which calls str() on the value, '!r' which calls repr() and '!a' which calls ascii() . Some examples: \"Harold's a clever {0!s} \" # Calls str() on the argument first \"Bring out the holy {name!r} \" # Calls repr() on the argument first \"More {!a} \" # Calls ascii() on the argument first The format_spec field contains a specification of how the value should be presented, including such details as field width, alignment, padding, decimal precision and so on. Each value type can define its own âformatting mini-languageâ or interpretation of the format_spec . Most built-in types support a common formatting mini-language, which is described in the next section. A format_spec field can also include nested replacement fields within it. These nested replacement fields may contain a field name, conversion flag and format specification, but deeper nesting is not allowed. The replacement fields within the format_spec are substituted before the format_spec string is interpreted. This allows the formatting of a value to be dynamically specified. See the Format examples section for some examples. Format Specification Mini-Language Â¶ âFormat specificationsâ are used within replacement fields contained within a format string to define how individual values are presented (see Format String Syntax , f-strings , and t-strings ). They can also be passed directly to the built-in format() function. Each formattable type may define how the format specification is to be interpreted. Most built-in types implement the following options for format specifications, although some of the formatting options are only supported by the numeric types. A general convention is that an empty format specification produces the same result as if you had called str() on the value. A non-empty format specification typically modifies the result. The general form of a standard format specifier is: format_spec : [ options ][ width_and_precision ][ type ] options : [[ fill ] align ][ sign ][ \"z\" ][ \"#\" ][ \"0\" ] fill : <any character> align : \"<\" | \">\" | \"=\" | \"^\" sign : \"+\" | \"-\" | \" \" width_and_precision : [ width_with_grouping ][ precision_with_grouping ] width_with_grouping : [ width ][ grouping ] precision_with_grouping : \".\" [ precision ][ grouping ] | \".\" grouping width : digit + precision : digit + grouping : \",\" | \"_\" type : \"b\" | \"c\" | \"d\" | \"e\" | \"E\" | \"f\" | \"F\" | \"g\" | \"G\" | \"n\" | \"o\" | \"s\" | \"x\" | \"X\" | \"%\" If a valid align value is specified, it can be preceded by a fill character that can be any character and defaults to a space if omitted. It is not possible to use a literal curly brace (â { â or â } â) as the fill character in a formatted string literal or when using the str.format() method. However, it is possible to insert a curly brace with a nested replacement field. This limitation doesnât affect the format() function. The meaning of the various alignment options is as follows: Option Meaning '<' Forces the field to be left-aligned within the available space (this is the default for most objects). '>' Forces the field to be right-aligned within the available space (this is the default for numbers). '=' Forces the padding to be placed after the sign (if any) but before the digits. This is used for printing fields in the form â+000000120â. This alignment option is only valid for numeric types, excluding complex . It becomes the default for numbers when â0â immediately precedes the field width. '^' Forces the field to be centered within the available space. Note that unless a minimum field width is defined, the field width will always be the same size as the data to fill it, so that the alignment option has no meaning in this case. The sign option is only valid for number types, and can be one of the following: Option Meaning '+' Indicates that a sign should be used for both positive as well as negative numbers. '-' Indicates that a sign should be used only for negative numbers (this is the default behavior). space Indicates that a leading space should be used on positive numbers, and a minus sign on negative numbers. The 'z' option coerces negative zero floating-point values to positive zero after rounding to the format precision. This option is only valid for floating-point presentation types. Changed in version 3.11: Added the 'z' option (see also PEP 682 ). The '#' option causes the âalternate formâ to be used for the conversion. The alternate form is defined differently for different types. This option is only valid for integer, float and complex types. For integers, when binary, octal, or hexadecimal output is used, this option adds the respective prefix '0b' , '0o' , '0x' , or '0X' to the output value. For float and complex the alternate form causes the result of the conversion to always contain a decimal-point character, even if no digits follow it. Normally, a decimal-point character appears in the result of these conversions only if a digit follows it. In addition, for 'g' and 'G' conversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the result. The width is a decimal integer defining the minimum total field width, including any prefixes, separators, and other formatting characters. If not specified, then the field width will be determined by the content. When no explicit alignment is given, preceding the width field by a zero ( '0' ) character enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types, excluding complex . This is equivalent to a fill character of '0' with an alignment type of '=' . Changed in version 3.10: Preceding the width field by '0' no longer affects the default alignment for strings. The precision is a decimal integer indicating how many digits should be displayed after the decimal point for presentation types 'f' and 'F' , or before and after the decimal point for presentation types 'g' or 'G' . For string presentation types the field indicates the maximum field size - in other words, how many characters will be used from the field content. The precision is not allowed for integer presentation types. The grouping option after width and precision fields specifies a digit group separator for the integral and fractional parts of a number respectively. It can be one of the following: Option Meaning ',' Inserts a comma every 3 digits for integer presentation type 'd' and floating-point presentation types, excluding 'n' . For other presentation types, this option is not supported. '_' Inserts an underscore every 3 digits for integer presentation type 'd' and floating-point presentation types, excluding 'n' . For integer presentation types 'b' , 'o' , 'x' , and 'X' , underscores are inserted every 4 digits. For other presentation types, this option is not supported. For a locale aware separator, use the 'n' presentation type instead. Changed in version 3.1: Added the ',' option (see also PEP 378 ). Changed in version 3.6: Added the '_' option (see also PEP 515 ). Changed in version 3.14: Support the grouping option for the fractional part. Finally, the type determines how the data should be presented. The available string presentation types are: Type Meaning 's' String format. This is the default type for strings and may be omitted. None The same as 's' . The available integer presentation types are: Type Meaning 'b' Binary format. Outputs the number in base 2. 'c' Character. Converts the integer to the corresponding unicode character before printing. 'd' Decimal Integer. Outputs the number in base 10. 'o' Octal format. Outputs the number in base 8. 'x' Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using lower-case letters for the digits above 9. 'X' Hex format. Outputs the number in base 16, using upper-case letters for the digits above 9. In case '#' is specified, the prefix '0x' will be upper-cased to '0X' as well. 'n' Number. This is the same as 'd' , except that it uses the current locale setting to insert the appropriate digit group separators. None The same as 'd' . In addition to the above presentation types, integers can be formatted with the floating-point presentation types listed below (except 'n' and None ). When doing so, float() is used to convert the integer to a floating-point number before formatting. The available presentation types for float and Decimal values are: Type Meaning 'e' Scientific notation. For a given precision p , formats the number in scientific notation with the letter âeâ separating the coefficient from the exponent. The coefficient has one digit before and p digits after the decimal point, for a total of p + 1 significant digits. With no precision given, uses a precision of 6 digits after the decimal point for float , and shows all coefficient digits for Decimal . If p=0 , the decimal point is omitted unless the # option is used. For float , the exponent always contains at least two digits, and is zero if the value is zero. 'E' Scientific notation. Same as 'e' except it uses an upper case âEâ as the separator character. 'f' Fixed-point notation. For a given precision p , formats the number as a decimal number with exactly p digits following the decimal point. With no precision given, uses a precision of 6 digits after the decimal point for float , and uses a precision large enough to show all coefficient digits for Decimal . If p=0 , the decimal point is omitted unless the # option is used. 'F' Fixed-point notation. Same as 'f' , but converts nan to NAN and inf to INF . 'g' General format. For a given precision p >= 1 , this rounds the number to p significant digits and then formats the result in either fixed-point format or in scientific notation, depending on its magnitude. A precision of 0 is treated as equivalent to a precision of 1 . The precise rules are as follows: suppose that the result formatted with presentation type 'e' and precision p-1 would have exponent exp . Then, if m <= exp < p , where m is -4 for floats and -6 for Decimals , the number is formatted with presentation type 'f' and precision p-1-exp . Otherwise, the number is formatted with presentation type 'e' and precision p-1 . In both cases insignificant trailing zeros are removed from the significand, and the decimal point is also removed if there are no remaining digits following it, unless the '#' option is used. With no precision given, uses a precision of 6 significant digits for float . For Decimal , the coefficient of the result is formed from the coefficient digits of the value; scientific notation is used for values smaller than 1e-6 in absolute value and values where the place value of the least significant digit is larger than 1, and fixed-point notation is used otherwise. Positive and negative infinity, positive and negative zero, and nans, are formatted as inf , -inf , 0 , -0 and nan respectively, regardless of the precision. 'G' General format. Same as 'g' except switches to 'E' if the number gets too large. The representations of infinity and NaN are uppercased, too. 'n' Number. This is the same as 'g' , except that it uses the current locale setting to insert the appropriate digit group separators for the integral part of a number. '%' Percentage. Multiplies the number by 100 and displays in fixed ( 'f' ) format, followed by a percent sign. None For float this is like the 'g' type, except that when fixed-point notation is used to format the result, it always includes at least one digit past the decimal point, and switches to the scientific notation when exp >= p - 1 . When the precision is not specified, the latter will be as large as needed to represent the given value faithfully. For Decimal , this is the same as either 'g' or 'G' depending on the value of context.capitals for the current decimal context. The overall effect is to match the output of str() as altered by the other format modifiers. The result should be correctly rounded to a given precision p of digits after the decimal point. The rounding mode for float matches that of the round() builtin. For Decimal , the rounding mode of the current context will be used. The available presentation types for complex are the same as those for float ( '%' is not allowed). Both the real and imaginary components of a complex number are formatted as floating-point numbers, according to the specified presentation type. They are separated by the mandatory sign of the imaginary part, the latter being terminated by a j suffix. If the presentation type is missing, the result will match the output of str() (complex numbers with a non-zero real part are also surrounded by parentheses), possibly altered by other format modifiers. Format examples Â¶ This section contains examples of the str.format() syntax and comparison with the old % -formatting. In most of the cases the syntax is similar to the old % -formatting, with the addition of the {} and with : used instead of % . For example, '%03.2f' can be translated to '{:03.2f}' . The new format syntax also supports new and different options, shown in the following examples. Accessing arguments by position: >>> ' {0} , {1} , {2} ' . format ( 'a' , 'b' , 'c' ) 'a, b, c' >>> ' {} , {} , {} ' . format ( 'a' , 'b' , 'c' ) # 3.1+ only 'a, b, c' >>> ' {2} , {1} , {0} ' . format ( 'a' , 'b' , 'c' ) 'c, b, a' >>> ' {2} , {1} , {0} ' . format ( * 'abc' ) # unpacking argument sequence 'c, b, a' >>> ' {0}{1}{0} ' . format ( 'abra' , 'cad' ) # arguments' indices can be repeated 'abracadabra' Accessing arguments by name: >>> 'Coordinates: {latitude} , {longitude} ' . format ( latitude = '37.24N' , longitude = '-115.81W' ) 'Coordinates: 37.24N, -115.81W' >>> coord = { 'latitude' : '37.24N' , 'longitude' : '-115.81W' } >>> 'Coordinates: {latitude} , {longitude} ' . format ( ** coord ) 'Coordinates: 37.24N, -115.81W' Accessing argumentsâ attributes: >>> c = 3 - 5 j >>> ( 'The complex number {0} is formed from the real part {0.real} ' ...

It predates str.format() , formatted string literals , and template string literals . It is unrelated to template string literals (t-strings), which were introduced in Python 3.14. These evaluate to string.templatelib.Template objects, found in the string.templatelib module. Template strings provide simpler string substitutions as described in PEP 292 . A primary use case for template strings is for internationalization (i18n) since in that context, the simpler syntax and functionality makes it easier to translate than other built-in string formatting facilities in Python. As an example of a library built on template strings for i18n, see the flufl.i18n package. Template strings support $ -based substitutions, using the following rules: $$ is an escape; it is replaced with a single $ . $identifier names a substitution placeholder matching a mapping key of \"identifier\" . By default, \"identifier\" is restricted to any case-insensitive ASCII alphanumeric string (including underscores) that starts with an underscore or ASCII letter. The first non-identifier character after the $ character terminates this placeholder specification. ${identifier} is equivalent to $identifier . It is required when valid identifier characters follow the placeholder but are not part of the placeholder, such as \"${noun}ification\" . Any other appearance of $ in the string will result in a ValueError being raised. The string module provides a Template class that implements these rules. The methods of Template are: class string. Template ( template ) Â¶ The constructor takes a single argument which is the template string. substitute ( mapping = {} , / , ** kwds ) Â¶ Performs the template substitution, returning a new string. mapping is any dictionary-like object with keys that match the placeholders in the template. Alternatively, you can provide keyword arguments, where the keywords are the placeholders. When both mapping and kwds are given and there are duplicates, the placeholders from kwds take precedence. safe_substitute ( mapping = {} , / , ** kwds ) Â¶ Like substitute() , except that if placeholders are missing from mapping and kwds , instead of raising a KeyError exception, the original placeholder will appear in the resulting string intact. Also, unlike with substitute() , any other appearances of the $ will simply return $ instead of raising ValueError . While other exceptions may still occur, this method is called âsafeâ because it always tries to return a usable string instead of raising an exception. In another sense, safe_substitute() may be anything other than safe, since it will silently ignore malformed templates containing dangling delimiters, unmatched braces, or placeholders that are not valid Python identifiers. is_valid ( ) Â¶ Returns False if the template has invalid placeholders that will cause substitute() to raise ValueError . Added in version 3.11. get_identifiers ( ) Â¶ Returns a list of the valid identifiers in the template, in the order they first appear, ignoring any invalid identifiers. Added in version 3.11. Template instances also provide one public data attribute: template Â¶ This is the object passed to the constructorâs template argument. In general, you shouldnât change it, but read-only access is not enforced. Here is an example of how to use a Template: >>> from string import Template >>> s = Template ( '$who likes $what' ) >>> s . substitute ( who = 'tim' , what = 'kung pao' ) 'tim likes kung pao' >>> d = dict ( who = 'tim' ) >>> Template ( 'Give $who $100' ) . substitute ( d ) Traceback (most recent call last): ... ValueError : Invalid placeholder in string: line 1, col 11 >>> Template ( '$who likes $what' ) . substitute ( d ) Traceback (most recent call last): ... KeyError : 'what' >>> Template ( '$who likes $what' ) . safe_substitute ( d ) 'tim likes $what' Advanced usage: you can derive subclasses of Template to customize the placeholder syntax, delimiter character, or the entire regular expression used to parse template strings. To do this, you can override these class attributes: delimiter â This is the literal string describing a placeholder introducing delimiter. The default value is $ . Note that this should not be a regular expression, as the implementation will call re.escape() on this string as needed. Note further that you cannot change the delimiter after class creation (i.e. a different delimiter must be set in the subclassâs class namespace). idpattern â This is the regular expression describing the pattern for non-braced placeholders. The default value is the regular expression (?a:[_a-z][_a-z0-9]*) . If this is given and braceidpattern is None this pattern will also apply to braced placeholders. Note Since default flags is re.IGNORECASE , pattern [a-z] can match with some non-ASCII characters. Thatâs why we use the local a flag here. Changed in version 3.7: braceidpattern can be used to define separate patterns used inside and outside the braces. braceidpattern â This is like idpattern but describes the pattern for braced placeholders. Defaults to None which means to fall back to idpattern (i.e. the same pattern is used both inside and outside braces). If given, this allows you to define different patterns for braced and unbraced placeholders. Added in version 3.7. flags â The regular expression flags that will be applied when compiling the regular expression used for recognizing substitutions. The default value is re.IGNORECASE . Note that re.VERBOSE will always be added to the flags, so custom idpattern s must follow conventions for verbose regular expressions. Added in version 3.2. Alternatively, you can provide the entire regular expression pattern by overriding the class attribute pattern . If you do this, the value must be a regular expression object with four named capturing groups. The capturing groups correspond to the rules given above, along with the invalid placeholder rule: escaped â This group matches the escape sequence, e.g. $$ , in the default pattern. named â This group matches the unbraced placeholder name; it should not include the delimiter in capturing group. braced â This group matches the brace enclosed placeholder name; it should not include either the delimiter or braces in the capturing group. invalid â This group matches any other delimiter pattern (usually a single delimiter), and it should appear last in the regular expression. The methods on this class will raise ValueError if the pattern matches the template without one of these named groups matching. Helper functions Â¶ string. capwords ( s , sep = None ) Â¶ Split the argument into words using str.split() , capitalize each word using str.capitalize() , and join the capitalized words using str.join() . If the optional second argument sep is absent or None , runs of whitespace characters are replaced by a single space and leading and trailing whitespace are removed, otherwise sep is used to split and join the words.",

      "text_content": "string.templatelib â Support for template string literals Â¶ Source code: Lib/string/templatelib.py See also Format strings Template string literal (t-string) syntax PEP 750 Template strings Â¶ Added in version 3.14. Template strings are a mechanism for custom string processing. They have the full flexibility of Pythonâs f-strings , but return a Template instance that gives access to the static and interpolated (in curly brackets) parts of a string before they are combined. To write a t-string, use a 't' prefix instead of an 'f' , like so: >>> pi = 3.14 >>> t 't-strings are new in Python {pi!s} !' Template( strings=('t-strings are new in Python ', '!'), interpolations=(Interpolation(3.14, 'pi', 's', ''),) ) Types Â¶ class string.templatelib. Template Â¶ The Template class describes the contents of a template string. It is immutable, meaning that attributes of a template cannot be reassigned. The most common way to create a Template instance is to use the template string literal syntax . This syntax is identical to that of f-strings , except that it uses a t prefix in place of an f : >>> cheese = 'Red Leicester' >>> template = t \"We're fresh out of {cheese} , sir.\" >>> type ( template ) <class 'string.templatelib.Template'> Templates are stored as sequences of literal strings and dynamic interpolations . A values attribute holds the values of the interpolations: >>> cheese = 'Camembert' >>> template = t 'Ah! We do have {cheese} .' >>> template . strings ('Ah! We do have ', '.') >>> template . interpolations (Interpolation('Camembert', ...),) >>> template . values ('Camembert',) The strings tuple has one more element than interpolations and values ; the interpolations âbelongâ between the strings. This may be easier to understand when tuples are aligned template . strings : ( 'Ah! We do have ' , '.' ) template . values : ( 'Camembert' , ) Attributes strings : tuple [ str , ... ] Â¶ A tuple of the static strings in the template. >>> cheese = 'Camembert' >>> template = t 'Ah! We do have {cheese} .' >>> template . strings ('Ah! We do have ', '.') Empty strings are included in the tuple: >>> response = 'We do have ' >>> cheese = 'Camembert' >>> template = t 'Ah! {response}{cheese} .' >>> template . strings ('Ah! ', '', '.') The strings tuple is never empty, and always contains one more string than the interpolations and values tuples: >>> t '' . strings ('',) >>> t '' . values () >>> t '{' cheese '}' . strings ('', '') >>> t '{' cheese '}' . values ('cheese',) interpolations : tuple [ Interpolation , ... ] Â¶ A tuple of the interpolations in the template. >>> cheese = 'Camembert' >>> template = t 'Ah! We do have {cheese} .' >>> template . interpolations (Interpolation('Camembert', 'cheese', None, ''),) The interpolations tuple may be empty and always contains one fewer values than the strings tuple: >>> t 'Red Leicester' . interpolations () values : tuple [ object , ... ] Â¶ A tuple of all interpolated values in the template. >>> cheese = 'Camembert' >>> template = t 'Ah! We do have {cheese} .' >>> template . values ('Camembert',) The values tuple always has the same length as the interpolations tuple. It is always equivalent to tuple(i.value for i in template.interpolations) . Methods __new__ ( * args : str | Interpolation ) Â¶ While literal syntax is the most common way to create a Template , it is also possible to create them directly using the constructor: >>> from string.templatelib import Interpolation , Template >>> cheese = 'Camembert' >>> template = Template ( ... 'Ah! We do have ' , Interpolation ( cheese , 'cheese' ), '.' ... ) >>> list ( template ) ['Ah! We do have ', Interpolation('Camembert', 'cheese', None, ''), '.'] If multiple strings are passed consecutively, they will be concatenated into a single value in the strings attribute. For example, the following code creates a Template with a single final string: >>> from string.templatelib import Template >>> template = Template ( 'Ah! We do have ' , 'Camembert' , '.' ) >>> template . strings ('Ah! We do have Camembert.',) If multiple interpolations are passed consecutively, they will be treated as separate interpolations and an empty string will be inserted between them. For example, the following code creates a template with empty placeholders in the strings attribute: >>> from string.templatelib import Interpolation , Template >>> template = Template ( ... Interpolation ( 'Camembert' , 'cheese' ), ... Interpolation ( '.' , 'punctuation' ), ... ) >>> template . strings ('', '', '') iter(template) Iterate over the template, yielding each non-empty string and Interpolation in the correct order: >>> cheese = 'Camembert' >>> list ( t 'Ah! We do have {cheese} .' ) ['Ah! We do have ', Interpolation('Camembert', 'cheese', None, ''), '.'] Caution Empty strings are not included in the iteration: >>> response = 'We do have ' >>> cheese = 'Camembert' >>> list ( t 'Ah! {response}{cheese} .' ) ['Ah! ', Interpolation('We do have ', 'response', None, ''), Interpolation('Camembert', 'cheese', None, ''), '.'] template + other template += other Concatenate this template with another, returning a new Template instance: >>> cheese = 'Camembert' >>> list ( t 'Ah! ' + t 'We do have {cheese} .' ) ['Ah! We do have ', Interpolation('Camembert', 'cheese', None, ''), '.'] Concatenating a Template and a str is not supported. This is because it is unclear whether the string should be treated as a static string or an interpolation. If you want to concatenate a Template with a string, you should either wrap the string directly in a Template (to treat it as a static string) or use an Interpolation (to treat it as dynamic): >>> from string.templatelib import Interpolation , Template >>> template = t 'Ah! ' >>> # Treat 'We do have ' as a static string >>> template += Template ( 'We do have ' ) >>> # Treat cheese as an interpolation >>> cheese = 'Camembert' >>> template += Template ( Interpolation ( cheese , 'cheese' )) >>> list ( template ) ['Ah! We do have ', Interpolation('Camembert', 'cheese', None, '')] class string.templatelib. Interpolation Â¶ The Interpolation type represents an expression inside a template string. It is immutable, meaning that attributes of an interpolation cannot be reassigned. Interpolations support pattern matching, allowing you to match against their attributes with the match statement : >>> from string.templatelib import Interpolation >>> interpolation = t '{1. + 2.:.2f}' . interpolations [ 0 ] >>> interpolation Interpolation(3.0, '1. + 2.', None, '.2f') >>> match interpolation : ... case Interpolation ( value , expression , conversion , format_spec ): ... print ( value , expression , conversion , format_spec , sep = ' | ' ) ... 3.0 | 1. + 2. | None | .2f Attributes value : object Â¶ The evaluated value of the interpolation. >>> t '{1 + 2}' . interpolations [ 0 ] . value 3 expression : str Â¶ For interpolations created by t-string literals, expression is the expression text found inside the curly brackets ( { & } ), including any whitespace, excluding the curly brackets themselves, and ending before the first ! , : , or = if any is present. For manually created interpolations, expression is the arbitrary string provided when constructing the interpolation instance. We recommend using valid Python expressions or the empty string for the expression field of manually created Interpolation instances, although this is not enforced at runtime. >>> t '{1 + 2}' . interpolations [ 0 ] . expression '1 + 2' conversion : Literal [ 'a' , 'r' , 's' ] | None Â¶ The conversion to apply to the value, or None . The conversion is the optional conversion to apply to the value: >>> t '{1 + 2!a}' . interpolations [ 0 ] . conversion 'a' Note Unlike f-strings, where conversions are applied automatically, the expected behavior with t-strings is that code that processes the Template will decide how to interpret and whether to apply the conversion . For convenience, the convert() function can be used to mimic f-string conversion semantics. format_spec : str Â¶ The format specification to apply to the value. The format_spec is an optional, arbitrary string used as the format specification to present the value: >>> t '{1 + 2:.2f}' . interpolations [ 0 ] . format_spec '.2f' Note Unlike f-strings, where format specifications are applied automatically via the format() protocol, the expected behavior with t-strings is that code that processes the interpolation will decide how to interpret and whether to apply the format specification. As a result, format_spec values in interpolations can be arbitrary strings, including those that do not conform to the format() protocol. Methods __new__ ( value : object , expression : str , conversion : Literal [ 'a' , 'r' , 's' ] | None = None , format_spec : str = '' ) Â¶ Create a new Interpolation object from component parts. Parameters : value â The evaluated, in-scope result of the interpolation. expression â The text of a valid Python expression, or an empty string. conversion â The conversion to be used, one of None , 'a' , 'r' , or 's' . format_spec â An optional, arbitrary string used as the format specification to present the value. Helper functions Â¶ string.templatelib. convert ( obj , / , conversion ) Â¶ Applies formatted string literal conversion semantics to the given object obj . This is frequently useful for custom template string processing logic. Three conversion flags are currently supported: 's' which calls str() on the value (like !s ), 'r' which calls repr() (like !r ), and 'a' which calls ascii() (like !a ). If the conversion flag is None , obj is returned unchanged.",

      "text_content": "re â Regular expression operations Â¶ Source code: Lib/re/ This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl. Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings ( str ) as well as 8-bit strings ( bytes ). However, Unicode strings and 8-bit strings cannot be mixed: that is, you cannot match a Unicode string with a bytes pattern or vice-versa; similarly, when asking for a substitution, the replacement string must be of the same type as both the pattern and the search string. Regular expressions use the backslash character ( '\\' ) to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Pythonâs usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write '\\\\\\\\' as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \\\\ , and each backslash must be expressed as \\\\ inside a regular Python string literal. Also, please note that any invalid escape sequences in Pythonâs usage of the backslash in string literals now generate a SyntaxWarning and in the future this will become a SyntaxError . This behaviour will happen even if it is a valid escape sequence for a regular expression. The solution is to use Pythonâs raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r' . So r\"\\n\" is a two-character string containing '\\' and 'n' , while \"\\n\" is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation. It is important to note that most regular expression operations are available as module-level functions and methods on compiled regular expressions . The functions are shortcuts that donât require you to compile a regex object first, but miss some fine-tuning parameters. See also The third-party regex module, which has an API compatible with the standard library re module, but offers additional functionality and a more thorough Unicode support. Regular Expression Syntax Â¶ A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string, which comes down to the same thing). Regular expressions can be concatenated to form new regular expressions; if A and B are both regular expressions, then AB is also a regular expression. In general, if a string p matches A and another string q matches B , the string pq will match AB. This holds unless A or B contain low precedence operations; boundary conditions between A and B ; or have numbered group references. Thus, complex expressions can easily be constructed from simpler primitive expressions like the ones described here. For details of the theory and implementation of regular expressions, consult the Friedl book [Frie09] , or almost any textbook about compiler construction. A brief explanation of the format of regular expressions follows. For further information and a gentler presentation, consult the Regular Expression HOWTO . Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters. Most ordinary characters, like 'A' , 'a' , or '0' , are the simplest regular expressions; they simply match themselves. You can concatenate ordinary characters, so last matches the string 'last' . (In the rest of this section, weâll write REâs in this special style , usually without quotes, and strings to be matched 'in single quotes' .) Some characters, like '|' or '(' , are special. Special characters either stand for classes of ordinary characters, or affect how the regular expressions around them are interpreted. Repetition operators or quantifiers ( * , + , ? , {m,n} , etc) cannot be directly nested. This avoids ambiguity with the non-greedy modifier suffix ? , and with other modifiers in other implementations. To apply a second repetition to an inner repetition, parentheses may be used. For example, the expression (?:a{6})* matches any multiple of six 'a' characters. The special characters are: . (Dot.) In the default mode, this matches any character except a newline. If the DOTALL flag has been specified, this matches any character including a newline. (?s:.) matches any character regardless of flags. ^ (Caret.) Matches the start of the string, and in MULTILINE mode also matches immediately after each newline. $ Matches the end of the string or just before the newline at the end of the string, and in MULTILINE mode also matches before a newline. foo matches both âfooâ and âfoobarâ, while the regular expression foo$ matches only âfooâ. More interestingly, searching for foo.$ in 'foo1\\nfoo2\\n' matches âfoo2â normally, but âfoo1â in MULTILINE mode; searching for a single $ in 'foo\\n' will find two (empty) matches: one just before the newline, and one at the end of the string. * Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE, as many repetitions as are possible. ab* will match âaâ, âabâ, or âaâ followed by any number of âbâs. + Causes the resulting RE to match 1 or more repetitions of the preceding RE. ab+ will match âaâ followed by any non-zero number of âbâs; it will not match just âaâ. ? Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding RE. ab? will match either âaâ or âabâ. *? , +? , ?? The '*' , '+' , and '?' quantifiers are all greedy ; they match as much text as possible. Sometimes this behaviour isnât desired; if the RE <.*> is matched against '<a> b <c>' , it will match the entire string, and not just '<a>' . Adding ? after the quantifier makes it perform the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few characters as possible will be matched. Using the RE <.*?> will match only '<a>' . *+ , ++ , ?+ Like the '*' , '+' , and '?' quantifiers, those where '+' is appended also match as many times as possible. However, unlike the true greedy quantifiers, these do not allow back-tracking when the expression following it fails to match. These are known as possessive quantifiers. For example, a*a will match 'aaaa' because the a* will match all 4 'a' s, but, when the final 'a' is encountered, the expression is backtracked so that in the end the a* ends up matching 3 'a' s total, and the fourth 'a' is matched by the final 'a' . However, when a*+a is used to match 'aaaa' , the a*+ will match all 4 'a' , but when the final 'a' fails to find any more characters to match, the expression cannot be backtracked and will thus fail to match. x*+ , x++ and x?+ are equivalent to (?>x*) , (?>x+) and (?>x?) correspondingly. Added in version 3.11. {m} Specifies that exactly m copies of the previous RE should be matched; fewer matches cause the entire RE not to match. For example, a{6} will match exactly six 'a' characters, but not five. {m,n} Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as many repetitions as possible. For example, a{3,5} will match from 3 to 5 'a' characters. Omitting m specifies a lower bound of zero, and omitting n specifies an infinite upper bound. As an example, a{4,}b will match 'aaaab' or a thousand 'a' characters followed by a 'b' , but not 'aaab' . The comma may not be omitted or the modifier would be confused with the previously described form. {m,n}? Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as few repetitions as possible. This is the non-greedy version of the previous quantifier. For example, on the 6-character string 'aaaaaa' , a{3,5} will match 5 'a' characters, while a{3,5}? will only match 3 characters. {m,n}+ Causes the resulting RE to match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, attempting to match as many repetitions as possible without establishing any backtracking points. This is the possessive version of the quantifier above. For example, on the 6-character string 'aaaaaa' , a{3,5}+aa attempt to match 5 'a' characters, then, requiring 2 more 'a' s, will need more characters than available and thus fail, while a{3,5}aa will match with a{3,5} capturing 5, then 4 'a' s by backtracking and then the final 2 'a' s are matched by the final aa in the pattern. x{m,n}+ is equivalent to (?>x{m,n}) . Added in version 3.11. \\ Either escapes special characters (permitting you to match characters like '*' , '?' , and so forth), or signals a special sequence; special sequences are discussed below. If youâre not using a raw string to express the pattern, remember that Python also uses the backslash as an escape sequence in string literals; if the escape sequence isnât recognized by Pythonâs parser, the backslash and subsequent character are included in the resulting string. However, if Python would recognize the resulting sequence, the backslash should be repeated twice. This is complicated and hard to understand, so itâs highly recommended that you use raw strings for all but the simplest expressions. [] Used to indicate a set of characters. In a set: Characters can be listed individually, e.g. [amk] will match 'a' , 'm' , or 'k' . Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating them by a '-' , for example [a-z] will match any lowercase ASCII letter, [0-5][0-9] will match all the two-digits numbers from 00 to 59 , and [0-9A-Fa-f] will match any hexadecimal digit. If - is escaped (e.g. [a\\-z] ) or if itâs placed as the first or last character (e.g. [-a] or [a-] ), it will match a literal '-' . Special characters except backslash lose their special meaning inside sets. For example, [(+*)] will match any of the literal characters '(' , '+' , '*' , or ')' . Backslash either escapes characters which have special meaning in a set such as '-' , ']' , '^' and '\\\\' itself or signals a special sequence which represents a single character such as \\xa0 or \\n or a character class such as \\w or \\S (defined below). Note that \\b represents a single âbackspaceâ character, not a word boundary as outside a set, and numeric escapes such as \\1 are always octal escapes, not group references. Special sequences which do not match a single character such as \\A and \\z are not allowed. Characters that are not within a range can be matched by complementing the set. If the first character of the set is '^' , all the characters that are not in the set will be matched. For example, [^5] will match any character except '5' , and [^^] will match any character except '^' . ^ has no special meaning if itâs not the first character in the set. To match a literal ']' inside a set, precede it with a backslash, or place it at the beginning of the set. For example, both [()[\\]{}] and []()[{}] will match a right bracket, as well as left bracket, braces, and parentheses. Support of nested sets and set operations as in Unicode Technical Standard #18 might be added in the future. This would change the syntax, so to facilitate this change a FutureWarning will be raised in ambiguous cases for the time being. That includes sets starting with a literal '[' or containing literal character sequences '--' , '&&' , '~~' , and '||' . To avoid a warning escape them with a backslash. Changed in version 3.7: FutureWarning is raised if a character set contains constructs that will change semantically in the future. | A|B , where A and B can be arbitrary REs, creates a regular expression that will match either A or B . An arbitrary number of REs can be separated by the '|' in this way. This can be used inside groups (see below) as well. As the target string is scanned, REs separated by '|' are tried from left to right. When one pattern completely matches, that branch is accepted. This means that once A matches, B will not be tested further, even if it would produce a longer overall match. In other words, the '|' operator is never greedy. To match a literal '|' , use \\| , or enclose it inside a character class, as in [|] . (...) Matches whatever regular expression is inside the parentheses, and indicates the start and end of a group; the contents of a group can be retrieved after a match has been performed, and can be matched later in the string with the \\number special sequence, described below. To match the literals '(' or ')' , use \\( or \\) , or enclose them inside a character class: [(] , [)] . (?...) This is an extension notation (a '?' following a '(' is not meaningful otherwise). The first character after the '?' determines what the meaning and further syntax of the construct is. Extensions usually do not create a new group; (?P<name>...) is the only exception to this rule. Following are the currently supported extensions. (?aiLmsux) (One or more letters from the set 'a' , 'i' , 'L' , 'm' , 's' , 'u' , 'x' .) The group matches the empty string; the letters set the corresponding flags for the entire regular expression: re.A (ASCII-only matching) re.I (ignore case) re.L (locale dependent) re.M (multi-line) re.S (dot matches all) re.U (Unicode matching) re.X (verbose) (The flags are described in Module Contents .) This is useful if you wish to include the flags as part of the regular expression, instead of passing a flag argument to the re.compile() function. Flags should be used first in the expression string. Changed in version 3.11: This construction can only be used at the start of the expression. (?:...) A non-capturing version of regular parentheses. Matches whatever regular expression is inside the parentheses, but the substring matched by the group cannot be retrieved after performing a match or referenced later in the pattern. (?aiLmsux-imsx:...) (Zero or more letters from the set 'a' , 'i' , 'L' , 'm' , 's' , 'u' , 'x' , optionally followed by '-' followed by one or more letters from the 'i' , 'm' , 's' , 'x' .) The letters set or remove the corresponding flags for the part of the expression: re.A (ASCII-only matching) re.I (ignore case) re.L (locale dependent) re.M (multi-line) re.S (dot matches all) re.U (Unicode matching) re.X (verbose) (The flags are described in Module Contents .) The letters 'a' , 'L' and 'u' are mutually exclusive when used as inline flags, so they canât be combined or follow '-' . Instead, when one of them appears in an inline group, it overrides the matching mode in the enclosing group. In Unicode patterns (?a:...) switches to ASCII-only matching, and (?u:...) switches to Unicode matching (default). In bytes patterns (?L:...) switches to locale dependent matching, and (?a:...) switches to ASCII-only matching (default). This override is only in effect for the narrow inline group, and the original matching mode is restored outside of the group. Added in version 3.6. Changed in version 3.7: The letters 'a' , 'L' and 'u' also can be used in a group. (?>...) Attempts to match ... as if it was a separate regular expression, and if successful, continues to match the rest of the pattern following it. If the subsequent pattern fails to match, the stack can only be unwound to a point before the (?>...) because once exited, the expression, known as an atomic group , has thrown away all stack points within itself. Thus, (?>.*). would never match anything because first the .* would match all characters possible, then, having nothing left to match, the final . would fail to match. Since there are no stack points saved in the Atomic Group, and there is no stack point before it, the entire expression would thus fail to match. Added in version 3.11. (?P<name>...) Similar to regular parentheses, but the substring matched by the group is accessible via the symbolic group name name . Group names must be valid Python identifiers, and in bytes patterns they can only contain bytes in the ASCII range. Each group name must be defined only once within a regular expression. A symbolic group is also a numbered group, just as if the group were not named. Named groups can be referenced in three contexts. If the pattern is (?P<quote>['\"]).*?(?P=quote) (i.e. matching a string quoted with either single or double quotes): Context of reference to group âquoteâ Ways to reference it in the same pattern itself (?P=quote) (as shown) \\1 when processing match object m m.group('quote') m.end('quote') (etc.) in a string passed to the repl argument of re.sub() \\g<quote> \\g<1> \\1 Changed in version 3.12: In bytes patterns, group name can only contain bytes in the ASCII range ( b'\\x00' - b'\\x7f' ). (?P=name) A backreference to a named group; it matches whatever text was matched by the earlier group named name . (?#...) A comment; the contents of the parentheses are simply ignored. (?=...) Matches if ... matches next, but doesnât consume any of the string. This is called a lookahead assertion . For example, Isaac (?=Asimov) will match 'Isaac ' only if itâs followed by 'Asimov' . (?!...) Matches if ... doesnât match next. This is a negative lookahead assertion . For example, Isaac (?!Asimov) will match 'Isaac ' only if itâs not followed by 'Asimov' . (?<=...) Matches if the current position in the string is preceded by a match for ... that ends at the current position. This is called a positive lookbehind assertion . (?<=abc)def will find a match in 'abcdef' , since the lookbehind will back up 3 characters and check if the contained pattern matches. The contained pattern must only match strings of some fixed length, meaning that abc or a|b are allowed, but a* and a{3,4} are not. Note that patterns which start with positive lookbehind assertions will not match at the beginning of the string being searched; you will most likely want to use the search() function rather than the match() function: >>> import re >>> m = re . search ( '(?<=abc)def' , 'abcdef' ) >>> m . group ( 0 ) 'def' This example looks for a word following a hyphen: >>> m = re . search ( r '(?<=-)\\w+' , 'spam-egg' ) >>> m . group ( 0 ) 'egg' Changed in version 3.5: Added support for group references of fixed length. (?<!...) Matches if the current position in the string is not preceded by a match for ... . This is called a negative lookbehind assertion . Similar to positive lookbehind assertions, the contained pattern must only match strings of some fixed length. Patterns which start with negative lookbehind assertions may match at the beginning of the string being searched. (?(id/name)yes-pattern|no-pattern) Will try to match with yes-pattern if the group with given id or name exists, and with no-pattern if it doesnât. no-pattern is optional and can be omitted. For example, (<)?(\\w+@\\w+(?:\\.\\w+)+)(?(1)>|$) is a poor email matching pattern, which will match with '<user@host.com>' as well as 'user@host.com' , but not with '<user@host.com' nor 'user@host.com>' . Changed in version 3.12: Group id can only contain ASCII digits. In bytes patterns, group name can only contain bytes in the ASCII range ( b'\\x00' - b'\\x7f' ). The special sequences consist of '\\' and a character from the list below. If the ordinary character is not an ASCII digit or an ASCII letter, then the resulting RE will match the second character. For example, \\$ matches the character '$' . \\number Matches the contents of the group of the same number. Groups are numbered starting from 1. For example, (.+) \\1 matches 'the the' or '55 55' , but not 'thethe' (note the space after the group). This special sequence can only be used to match one of the first 99 groups. If the first digit of number is 0, or number is 3 octal digits long, it will not be interpreted as a group match, but as the character with octal value number . Inside the '[' and ']' of a character class, all numeric escapes are treated as characters. \\A Matches only at the start of the string. \\b Matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or end of a word. A word is defined as a sequence of word characters. Note that formally, \\b is defined as the boundary between a \\w and a \\W character (or vice versa), or between \\w and the beginning or end of the string. This means that r'\\bat\\b' matches 'at' , 'at.' , '(at)' , and 'as at ay' but not 'attempt' or 'atlas' . The default word characters in Unicode (str) patterns are Unicode alphanumerics and the underscore, but this can be changed by using the ASCII flag. Word boundaries are determined by the current locale if the LOCALE flag is used. Note Inside a character range, \\b represents the backspace character, for compatibility with Pythonâs string literals. \\B Matches the empty string, but only when it is not at the beginning or end of a word. This means that r'at\\B' matches 'athens' , 'atom' , 'attorney' , but not 'at' , 'at.' , or 'at!' . \\B is the opposite of \\b , so word characters in Unicode (str) patterns are Unicode alphanumerics or the underscore, although this can be changed by using the ASCII flag. Word boundaries are determined by the current locale if the LOCALE flag is used. Changed in version 3.14: \\B now matches empty input string. \\d For Unicode (str) patterns: Matches any Unicode decimal digit (that is, any character in Unicode character category [Nd] ). This includes [0-9] , and also many other digit characters. Matches [0-9] if the ASCII flag is used. For 8-bit (bytes) patterns: Matches any decimal digit in the ASCII character set; this is equivalent to [0-9] . \\D Matches any character which is not a decimal digit. This is the opposite of \\d . Matches [^0-9] if the ASCII flag is used. \\s For Unicode (str) patterns: Matches Unicode whitespace characters (as defined by str.isspace() ). This includes [ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v] , and also many other characters, for example the non-breaking spaces mandated by typography rules in many languages. Matches [ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v] if the ASCII flag is used. For 8-bit (bytes) patterns: Matches characters considered whitespace in the ASCII character set; this is equivalent to [ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v] . \\S Matches any character which is not a whitespace character. This is the opposite of \\s . Matches [^ \\t\\n\\r\\f\\v] if the ASCII flag is used. \\w For Unicode (str) patterns: Matches Unicode word characters; this includes all Unicode alphanumeric characters (as defined by str.isalnum() ), as well as the underscore ( _ ). Matches [a-zA-Z0-9_] if the ASCII flag is used. For 8-bit (bytes) patterns: Matches characters considered alphanumeric in the ASCII character set; this is equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_] . If the LOCALE flag is used, matches characters considered alphanumeric in the current locale and the underscore. \\W Matches any character which is not a word character. This is the opposite of \\w . By default, matches non-underscore ( _ ) characters for which str.isalnum() returns False . Matches [^a-zA-Z0-9_] if the ASCII flag is used. If the LOCALE flag is used, matches characters which are neither alphanumeric in the current locale nor the underscore. \\z Matches only at the end of the string. Added in version 3.14. \\Z The same as \\z . For compatibility with old Python versions. Most of the escape sequences supported by Python string literals are also accepted by the regular expression parser: \\ a \\ b \\ f \\ n \\ N \\ r \\ t \\ u \\ U \\ v \\ x \\\\ (Note that \\b is used to represent word boundaries, and means âbackspaceâ only inside character classes.) '\\u' , '\\U' , and '\\N' escape sequences are only recognized in Unicode (str) patterns. In bytes patterns they are errors. Unknown escapes of ASCII letters are reserved for future use and treated as errors. Octal escapes are included in a limited form. If the first digit is a 0, or if there are three octal digits, it is considered an octal escape. Otherwise, it is a group reference. As for string literals, octal escapes are always at most three digits in length. Changed in version 3.3: The '\\u' and '\\U' escape sequences have been added. Changed in version 3.6: Unknown escapes consisting of '\\' and an ASCII letter now are errors. Changed in version 3.8: The '\\N{ name }' escape sequence has been added. As in string literals, it expands to the named Unicode character (e.g. '\\N{EM DASH}' ). Module Contents Â¶ The module defines several functions, constants, and an exception. Some of the functions are simplified versions of the full featured methods for compiled regular expressions. Most non-trivial applications always use the compiled form. Flags Â¶ Changed in version 3.6: Flag constants are now instances of RegexFlag , which is a subclass of enum.IntFlag . class re. RegexFlag Â¶ An enum.IntFlag class containing the regex options listed below. Added in version 3.11: - added to __all__ re. A Â¶ re. ASCII Â¶ Make \\w , \\W , \\b , \\B , \\d , \\D , \\s and \\S perform ASCII-only matching instead of full Unicode matching. This is only meaningful for Unicode (str) patterns, and is ignored for bytes patterns. Corresponds to the inline flag (?a) . Note The U flag still exists for backward compatibility, but is redundant in Python 3 since matches are Unicode by default for str patterns, and Unicode matching isnât allowed for bytes patterns. UNICODE and the inline flag (?u) are similarly redundant. re. DEBUG Â¶ Display debug information about compiled expression. No corresponding inline flag. re. I Â¶ re. IGNORECASE Â¶ Perform case-insensitive matching; expressions like [A-Z] will also match lowercase letters. Full Unicode matching (such as Ã matching Ã¼ ) also works unless the ASCII flag is used to disable non-ASCII matches. The current locale does not change the effect of this flag unless the LOCALE flag is also used. Corresponds to the inline flag (?i) . Note that when the Unicode patterns [a-z] or [A-Z] are used in combination with the IGNORECASE flag, they will match the 52 ASCII letters and 4 additional non-ASCII letters: âÄ°â (U+0130, Latin capital letter I with dot above), âÄ±â (U+0131, Latin small letter dotless i), âÅ¿â (U+017F, Latin small letter long s) and ââªâ (U+212A, Kelvin sign). If the ASCII flag is used, only letters âaâ to âzâ and âAâ to âZâ are matched. re. L Â¶ re. LOCALE Â¶ Make \\w , \\W , \\b , \\B and case-insensitive matching dependent on the current locale. This flag can be used only with bytes patterns. Corresponds to the inline flag (?L) . Warning This flag is discouraged; consider Unicode matching instead. The locale mechanism is very unreliable as it only handles one âcultureâ at a time and only works with 8-bit locales. Unicode matching is enabled by default for Unicode (str) patterns and it is able to handle different locales and languages. Changed in version 3.6: LOCALE can be used only with bytes patterns and is not compatible with ASCII . Changed in version 3.7: Compiled regular expression objects with the LOCALE flag no longer depend on the locale at compile time. Only the locale at matching time affects the result of matching. re. M Â¶ re. MULTILINE Â¶ When specified, the pattern character '^' matches at the beginning of the string and at the beginning of each line (immediately following each newline); and the pattern character '$' matches at the end of the string and at the end of each line (immediately preceding each newline). By default, '^' matches only at the beginning of the string, and '$' only at the end of the string and immediately before the newline (if any) at the end of the string. Corresponds to the inline flag (?m) . re. NOFLAG Â¶ Indicates no flag being applied, the value is 0 . This flag may be used as a default value for a function keyword argument or as a base value that will be conditionally ORed with other flags. Example of use as a default value: def myfunc ( text , flag = re . NOFLAG ): return re . match ( text , flag ) Added in version 3.11. re. S Â¶ re. DOTALL Â¶ Make the '.' special character match any character at all, including a newline; without this flag, '.' will match anything except a newline. Corresponds to the inline flag (?s) . re. U Â¶ re. UNICODE Â¶ In Python 3, Unicode characters are matched by default for str patterns. This flag is therefore redundant with no effect and is only kept for backward compatibility. See ASCII to restrict matching to ASCII characters instead. re. X Â¶ re. VERBOSE Â¶ This flag allows you to write regular expressions that look nicer and are more readable by allowing you to visually separate logical sections of the pattern and add comments. Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except when in a character class, or when preceded by an unescaped backslash, or within tokens like *? , (?: or (?P<...> . For example, (? : and * ? are not allowed. When a line contains a # that is not in a character class and is not preceded by an unescaped backslash, all characters from the leftmost such # through the end of the line are ignored. This means that the two following regular expression objects that match a decimal number are functionally equal: a = re . compile ( r \"\"\"\\d + # the integral part \\. # the decimal point \\d * # some fractional digits\"\"\" , re . X ) b = re . compile ( r \"\\d+\\.\\d*\" ) Corresponds to the inline flag (?x) . Functions Â¶ re. compile ( pattern , flags = 0 ) Â¶ Compile a regular expression pattern into a regular expression object , which can be used for matching using its match() , search() and other methods, described below. The expressionâs behaviour can be modified by specifying a flags value. Values can be any of the flags variables, combined using bitwise OR (the | operator). The sequence prog = re . compile ( pattern ) result = prog . match ( string ) is equivalent to result = re . match ( pattern , string ) but using re.compile() and saving the resulting regular expression object for reuse is more efficient when the expression will be used several times in a single program. Note The compiled versions of the most recent patterns passed to re.compile() and the module-level matching functions are cached, so programs that use only a few regular expressions at a time neednât worry about compiling regular expressions. re. search ( pattern , string , flags = 0 ) Â¶ Scan through string looking for the first location where the regular expression pattern produces a match, and return a corresponding Match . Return None if no position in the string matches the pattern; note that this is different from finding a zero-length match at some point in the string. The expressionâs behaviour can be modified by specifying a flags value. Values can be any of the flags variables, combined using bitwise OR (the | operator). re. match ( pattern , string , flags = 0 ) Â¶ If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match the regular expression pattern , return a corresponding Match . Return None if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match. Note that even in MULTILINE mode, re.match() will only match at the beginning of the string and not at the beginning of each line. If you want to locate a match anywhere in string , use search() instead (see also search() vs. match() ). The expressionâs behaviour can be modified by specifying a flags value. Values can be any of the flags variables, combined using bitwise OR (the | operator). re. fullmatch ( pattern , string , flags = 0 ) Â¶ If the whole string matches the regular expression pattern , return a corresponding Match . Return None if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match. The expressionâs behaviour can be modified by specifying a flags value. Values can be any of the flags variables, combined using bitwise OR (the | operator). Added in version 3.4. re. split ( pattern , string , maxsplit = 0 , flags = 0 ) Â¶ Split string by the occurrences of pattern . If capturing parentheses are used in pattern , then the text of all groups in the pattern are also returned as part of the resulting list. If maxsplit is nonzero, at most maxsplit splits occur, and the remainder of the string is returned as the final element of the list. >>> re . split ( r '\\W+' , 'Words, words, words.' ) ['Words', 'words', 'words', ''] >>> re . split ( r '(\\W+)' , 'Words, words, words.' ) ['Words', ', ', 'words', ', ', 'words', '.', ''] >>> re . split ( r '\\W+' , 'Words, words, words.' , maxsplit = 1 ) ['Words', 'words, words.'] >>> re . split ( '[a-f]+' , '0a3B9' , flags = re . IGNORECASE ) ['0', '3', '9'] If there are capturing groups in the separator and it matches at the start of the string, the result will start with an empty string. The same holds for the end of the string: >>> re . split ( r '(\\W+)' , '...words, words...' ) ['', '...', 'words', ', ', 'words', '...', ''] That way, separator components are always found at the same relative indices within the result list. Adjacent empty matches are not possible, but an empty match can occur immediately after a non-empty match. >>> re . split ( r '\\b' , 'Words, words, words.' ) ['', 'Words', ', ', 'words', ', ', 'words', '.'] >>> re . split ( r '\\W*' , '...words...' ) ['', '', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'd', 's', '', ''] >>> re . split ( r '(\\W*)' , '...words...' ) ['', '...', '', '', 'w', '', 'o', '', 'r', '', 'd', '', 's', '...', '', '', ''] The expressionâs behaviour can be modified by specifying a flags value. Values can be any of the flags variables, combined using bitwise OR (the | operator). Changed in version 3.1: Added the optional flags argument. Changed in version 3.7: Added support of splitting on a pattern that could match an empty string. Deprecated since version 3.13: Passing maxsplit and flags as positional arguments is deprecated. In future Python versions they will be keyword-only parameters . re. findall ( pattern , string , flags = 0 ) Â¶ Return all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string , as a list of strings or tuples. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. Empty matches are included in the result. The result depends on the number of capturing groups in the pattern. If there are no groups, return a list of strings matching the whole pattern. If there is exactly one group, return a list of strings matching that group. If multiple groups are present, return a list of tuples of strings matching the groups. Non-capturing groups do not affect the form of the result. >>> re . findall ( r '\\bf[a-z]*' , 'which foot or hand fell fastest' ) ['foot', 'fell', 'fastest'] >>> re . findall ( r '(\\w+)=(\\d+)' , 'set width=20 and height=10' ) [('width', '20'), ('height', '10')] The expressionâs behaviour can be modified by specifying a flags value. Values can be any of the flags variables, combined using bitwise OR (the | operator). Changed in version 3.7: Non-empty matches can now start just after a previous empty match. re. finditer ( pattern , string , flags = 0 ) Â¶ Return an iterator yielding Match objects over all non-overlapping matches for the RE pattern in string . The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. Empty matches are included in the result. The expressionâs behaviour can be modified by specifying a flags value. Values can be any of the flags variables, combined using bitwise OR (the | operator). Changed in version 3.7: Non-empty matches can now start just after a previous empty match. re. sub ( pattern , repl , string , count = 0 , flags = 0 ) Â¶ Return the string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of pattern in string by the replacement repl . If the pattern isnât found, string is returned unchanged. repl can be a string or a function; if it is a string, any backslash escapes in it are processed. That is, \\n is converted to a single newline character, \\r is converted to a carriage return, and so forth. Unknown escapes of ASCII letters are reserved for future use and treated as errors. Other unknown escapes such as \\& are left alone. Backreferences, such as \\6 , are replaced with the substring matched by group 6 in the pattern. For example: >>> re . sub ( r 'def\\s+([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*)\\s*\\(\\s*\\):' , ... r 'static PyObject*\\npy_\\1(void)\\n{' , ... 'def myfunc():' ) 'static PyObject*\\npy_myfunc(void)\\n{' If repl is a function, it is called for every non-overlapping occurrence of pattern . The function takes a single Match argument, and returns the replacement string. For example: >>> def dashrepl ( matchobj ): ... if matchobj . group ( 0 ) == '-' : return ' ' ... else : return '-' ... >>> re . sub ( '-{1,2}' , dashrepl , 'pro----gram-files' ) 'pro--gram files' >>> re . sub ( r '\\sAND\\s' , ' & ' , 'Baked Beans And Spam' , flags = re . IGNORECASE ) 'Baked Beans & Spam' The pattern may be a string or a Pattern . The optional argument count is the maximum number of pattern occurrences to be replaced; count must be a non-negative integer. If omitted or zero, all occurrences will be replaced. Adjacent empty matches are not possible, but an empty match can occur immediately after a non-empty match. As a result, sub('x*', '-', 'abxd') returns '-a-b--d-' instead of '-a-b-d-' . In string-type repl arguments, in addition to the character escapes and backreferences described above, \\g<name> will use the substring matched by the group named name , as defined by the (?P<name>...) syntax. \\g<number> uses the corresponding group number; \\g<2> is therefore equivalent to \\2 , but isnât ambiguous in a replacement such as \\g<2>0 . \\20 would be interpreted as a reference to group 20, not a reference to group 2 followed by the literal character '0' . The backreference \\g<0> substitutes in the entire substring matched by the RE. The expressionâs behaviour can be modified by specifying a flags value. Values can be any of the flags variables, combined using bitwise OR (the | operator). Changed in version 3.1: Added the optional flags argument. Changed in version 3.5: Unmatched groups are replaced with an empty string. Changed in version 3.6: Unknown escapes in pattern consisting of '\\' and an ASCII letter now are errors. Changed in version 3.7: Unknown escapes in repl consisting of '\\' and an ASCII letter now are errors. An empty match can occur immediately after a non-empty match. Changed in version 3.12: Group id can only contain ASCII digits. In bytes replacement strings, group name can only contain bytes in the ASCII range ( b'\\x00' - b'\\x7f' ). Deprecated since version 3.13: Passing count and flags as positional arguments is deprecated. In future Python versions they will be keyword-only parameters . re. subn ( pattern , repl , string , count = 0 , flags = 0 ) Â¶ Perform the same operation as sub() , but return a tuple (new_string, number_of_subs_made) . The expressionâs behaviour can be modified by specifying a flags value. Values can be any of the flags variables, combined using bitwise OR (the | operator). re. escape ( pattern ) Â¶ Escape special characters in pattern . This is useful if you want to match an arbitrary literal string that may have regular expression metacharacters in it. For example: >>> print ( re . escape ( 'https://www.python.org' )) https://www\\.python\\.org >>> legal_chars = string . ascii_lowercase + string . digits + \"!#$%&'*+-.^_`|~:\" >>> print ( '[ %s ]+' % re . escape ( legal_chars )) [abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!\\#\\$%\\&'\\*\\+\\-\\.\\^_`\\|\\~:]+ >>> operators = [ '+' , '-' , '*' , '/' , '**' ] >>> print ( '|' . join ( map ( re . escape , sorted ( operators , reverse = True )))) /|\\-|\\+|\\*\\*|\\* This function must not be used for the replacement string in sub() and subn() , only backslashes should be escaped. For example: >>> digits_re = r '\\d+' >>> sample = '/usr/sbin/sendmail - 0 errors, 12 warnings' >>> print ( re . sub ( digits_re , digits_re . replace ( ' \\\\ ' , r ' \\\\ ' ), sample )) /usr/sbin/sendmail - \\d+ errors, \\d+ warnings Changed in version 3.3: The '_' character is no longer escaped. Changed in version 3.7: Only characters that can have special meaning in a regular expression are escaped. As a result, '!' , '\"' , '%' , \"'\" , ',' , '/' , ':' , ';' , '<' , '=' , '>' , '@' , and \"`\" are no longer escaped. re. purge ( ) Â¶ Clear the regular expression cache. Exceptions Â¶ exception re. PatternError ( msg , pattern = None , pos = None ) Â¶ Exception raised when a string passed to one of the functions here is not a valid regular expression (for example, it might contain unmatched parentheses) or when some other error occurs during compilation or matching. It is never an error if a string contains no match for a pattern. The PatternError instance has the following additional attributes: msg Â¶ The unformatted error message. pattern Â¶ The regular expression pattern. pos Â¶ The index in pattern where compilation failed (may be None ). lineno Â¶ The line corresponding to pos (may be None ). colno Â¶ The column corresponding to pos (may be None ). Changed in version 3.5: Added additional attributes. Changed in version 3.13: PatternError was originally named error ; the latter is kept as an alias for backward compatibility. Regular Expression Objects Â¶ class re. Pattern Â¶ Compiled regular expression object returned by re.compile() . Changed in version 3.9: re.Pattern supports [] to indicate a Unicode (str) or bytes pattern. See Generic Alias Type . Pattern. search ( string [ , pos [ , endpos ] ] ) Â¶ Scan through string looking for the first location where this regular expression produces a match, and return a corresponding Match . Return None if no position in the string matches the pattern; note that this is different from finding a zero-length match at some point in the string. The optional second parameter pos gives an index in the string where the search is to start; it defaults to 0 . This is not completely equivalent to slicing the string; the '^' pattern character matches at the real beginning of the string and at positions just after a newline, but not necessarily at the index where the search is to start. The optional parameter endpos limits how far the string will be searched; it will be as if the string is endpos characters long, so only the characters from pos to endpos - 1 will be searched for a match. If endpos is less than pos , no match will be found; otherwise, if rx is a compiled regular expression object, rx.search(string, 0, 50) is equivalent to rx.search(string[:50], 0) . >>> pattern = re . compile ( \"d\" ) >>> pattern . search ( \"dog\" ) # Match at index 0 <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='d'> >>> pattern . search ( \"dog\" , 1 ) # No match; search doesn't include the \"d\" Pattern. match ( string [ , pos [ , endpos ] ] ) Â¶ If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match this regular expression, return a corresponding Match . Return None if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match. The optional pos and endpos parameters have the same meaning as for the search() method. >>> pattern = re . compile ( \"o\" ) >>> pattern . match ( \"dog\" ) # No match as \"o\" is not at the start of \"dog\". >>> pattern . match ( \"dog\" , 1 ) # Match as \"o\" is the 2nd character of \"dog\". <re.Match object; span=(1, 2), match='o'> If you want to locate a match anywhere in string , use search() instead (see also search() vs. match() ). Pattern. fullmatch ( string [ , pos [ , endpos ] ] ) Â¶ If the whole string matches this regular expression, return a corresponding Match . Return None if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match. The optional pos and endpos parameters have the same meaning as for the search() method. >>> pattern = re . compile ( \"o[gh]\" ) >>> pattern . fullmatch ( \"dog\" ) # No match as \"o\" is not at the start of \"dog\". >>> pattern . fullmatch ( \"ogre\" ) # No match as not the full string matches. >>> pattern . fullmatch ( \"doggie\" , 1 , 3 ) # Matches within given limits. <re.Match object; span=(1, 3), match='og'> Added in version 3.4. Pattern. split ( string , maxsplit = 0 ) Â¶ Identical to the split() function, using the compiled pattern. Pattern. findall ( string [ , pos [ , endpos ] ] ) Â¶ Similar to the findall() function, using the compiled pattern, but also accepts optional pos and endpos parameters that limit the search region like for search() . Pattern. finditer ( string [ , pos [ , endpos ] ] ) Â¶ Similar to the finditer() function, using the compiled pattern, but also accepts optional pos and endpos parameters that limit the search region like for search() . Pattern. sub ( repl , string , count = 0 ) Â¶ Identical to the sub() function, using the compiled pattern. Pattern. subn ( repl , string , count = 0 ) Â¶ Identical to the subn() function, using the compiled pattern. Pattern. flags Â¶ The regex matching flags. This is a combination of the flags given to compile() , any (?...) inline flags in the pattern, and implicit flags such as UNICODE if the pattern is a Unicode string. Pattern. groups Â¶ The number of capturing groups in the pattern. Pattern. groupindex Â¶ A dictionary mapping any symbolic group names defined by (?P<id>) to group numbers. The dictionary is empty if no symbolic groups were used in the pattern. Pattern. pattern Â¶ The pattern string from which the pattern object was compiled. Changed in version 3.7: Added support of copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy() . Compiled regular expression objects are considered atomic. Match Objects Â¶ Match objects always have a boolean value of True . Since match() and search() return None when there is no match, you can test whether there was a match with a simple if statement: match = re . search ( pattern , string ) if match : process ( match ) class re. Match Â¶ Match object returned by successful match es and search es. Changed in version 3.9: re.Match supports [] to indicate a Unicode (str) or bytes match. See Generic Alias Type . Match. expand ( template ) Â¶ Return the string obtained by doing backslash substitution on the template string template , as done by the sub() method. Escapes such as \\n are converted to the appropriate characters, and numeric backreferences ( \\1 , \\2 ) and named backreferences ( \\g<1> , \\g<name> ) are replaced by the contents of the corresponding group. The backreference \\g<0> will be replaced by the entire match. Changed in version 3.5: Unmatched groups are replaced with an empty string. Match. group ( [ group1 , ... ] ) Â¶ Returns one or more subgroups of the match. If there is a single argument, the result is a single string; if there are multiple arguments, the result is a tuple with one item per argument. Without arguments, group1 defaults to zero (the whole match is returned). If a groupN argument is zero, the corresponding return value is the entire matching string; if it is in the inclusive range [1..99], it is the string matching the corresponding parenthesized group. If a group number is negative or larger than the number of groups defined in the pattern, an IndexError exception is raised. If a group is contained in a part of the pattern that did not match, the corresponding result is None . If a group is contained in a part of the pattern that matched multiple times, the last match is returned. >>> m = re . match ( r \"(\\w+) (\\w+)\" , \"Isaac Newton, physicist\" ) >>> m . group ( 0 ) # The entire match 'Isaac Newton' >>> m . group ( 1 ) # The first parenthesized subgroup. 'Isaac' >>> m . group ( 2 ) # The second parenthesized subgroup. 'Newton' >>> m . group ( 1 , 2 ) # Multiple arguments give us a tuple. ('Isaac', 'Newton') If the regular expression uses the (?P<name>...) syntax, the groupN arguments may also be strings identifying groups by their group name. If a string argument is not used as a group name in the pattern, an IndexError exception is raised. A moderately complicated example: >>> m = re . match ( r \"(?P<first_name>\\w+) (?P<last_name>\\w+)\" , \"Malcolm Reynolds\" ) >>> m . group ( 'first_name' ) 'Malcolm' >>> m . group ( 'last_name' ) 'Reynolds' Named groups can also be referred to by their index: >>> m . group ( 1 ) 'Malcolm' >>> m . group ( 2 ) 'Reynolds' If a group matches multiple times, only the last match is accessible: >>> m = re . match ( r \"(..)+\" , \"a1b2c3\" ) # Matches 3 times. >>> m . group ( 1 ) # Returns only the last match. 'c3' Match. __getitem__ ( g ) Â¶ This is identical to m.group(g) . This allows easier access to an individual group from a match: >>> m = re . match ( r \"(\\w+) (\\w+)\" , \"Isaac Newton, physicist\" ) >>> m [ 0 ] # The entire match 'Isaac Newton' >>> m [ 1 ] # The first parenthesized subgroup. 'Isaac' >>> m [ 2 ] # The second parenthesized subgroup. 'Newton' Named groups are supported as well: >>> m = re . match ( r \"(?P<first_name>\\w+) (?P<last_name>\\w+)\" , \"Isaac Newton\" ) >>> m [ 'first_name' ] 'Isaac' >>> m [ 'last_name' ] 'Newton' Added in version 3.6. Match. groups ( default = None ) Â¶ Return a tuple containing all the subgroups of the match, from 1 up to however many groups are in the pattern. The default argument is used for groups that did not participate in the match; it defaults to None . For example: >>> m = re . match ( r \"(\\d+)\\.(\\d+)\" , \"24.1632\" ) >>> m . groups () ('24', '1632') If we make the decimal place and everything after it optional, not all groups might participate in the match. These groups will default to None unless the default argument is given: >>> m = re . match ( r \"(\\d+)\\.?(\\d+)?\" , \"24\" ) >>> m . groups () # Second group defaults to None. ('24', None) >>> m . groups ( '0' ) # Now, the second group defaults to '0'. ('24', '0') Match. groupdict ( default = None ) Â¶ Return a dictionary containing all the named subgroups of the match, keyed by the subgroup name. The default argument is used for groups that did not participate in the match; it defaults to None . For example: >>> m = re . match ( r \"(?P<first_name>\\w+) (?P<last_name>\\w+)\" , \"Malcolm Reynolds\" ) >>> m . groupdict () {'first_name': 'Malcolm', 'last_name': 'Reynolds'} Match. start ( [ group ] ) Â¶ Match. end ( [ group ] ) Â¶ Return the indices of the start and end of the substring matched by group ; group defaults to zero (meaning the whole matched substring). Return -1 if group exists but did not contribute to the match. For a match object m , and a group g that did contribute to the match, the substring matched by group g (equivalent to m.group(g) ) is m . string [ m . start ( g ): m . end ( g )] Note that m.start(group) will equal m.end(group) if group matched a null string. For example, after m = re.search('b(c?)', 'cba') , m.start(0) is 1, m.end(0) is 2, m.start(1) and m.end(1) are both 2, and m.start(2) raises an IndexError exception. An example that will remove remove_this from email addresses: >>> email = \"tony@tiremove_thisger.net\" >>> m = re . search ( \"remove_this\" , email ) >>> email [: m . start ()] + email [ m . end ():] 'tony@tiger.net' Match. span ( [ group ] ) Â¶ For a match m , return the 2-tuple (m.start(group), m.end(group)) . Note that if group did not contribute to the match, this is (-1, -1) . group defaults to zero, the entire match. Match. pos Â¶ The value of pos which was passed to the search() or match() method of a regex object . This is the index into the string at which the RE engine started looking for a match. Match. endpos Â¶ The value of endpos which was passed to the search() or match() method of a regex object . This is the index into the string beyond which the RE engine will not go. Match. lastindex Â¶ The integer index of the last matched capturing group, or None if no group was matched at all. For example, the expressions (a)b , ((a)(b)) , and ((ab)) will have lastindex == 1 if applied to the string 'ab' , while the expression (a)(b) will have lastindex == 2 , if applied to the same string. Match. lastgroup Â¶ The name of the last matched capturing group, or None if the group didnât have a name, or if no group was matched at all. Match. re Â¶ The regular expression object whose match() or search() method produced this match instance. Match. string Â¶ The string passed to match() or search() . Changed in version 3.7: Added support of copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy() . Match objects are considered atomic. Regular Expression Examples Â¶ Checking for a Pair Â¶ In this example, weâll use the following helper function to display match objects a little more gracefully: def displaymatch ( match ): if match is None : return None return '<Match: %r , groups= %r >' % ( match . group (), match . groups ()) Suppose you are writing a poker program where a playerâs hand is represented as a 5-character string with each character representing a card, âaâ for ace, âkâ for king, âqâ for queen, âjâ for jack, âtâ for 10, and â2â through â9â representing the card with that value. To see if a given string is a valid hand, one could do the following: >>> valid = re . compile ( r \"^[a2-9tjqk] {5} $\" ) >>> displaymatch ( valid . match ( \"akt5q\" )) # Valid. \"<Match: 'akt5q', groups=()>\" >>> displaymatch ( valid . match ( \"akt5e\" )) # Invalid. >>> displaymatch ( valid . match ( \"akt\" )) # Invalid. >>> displaymatch ( valid . match ( \"727ak\" )) # Valid. \"<Match: '727ak', groups=()>\" That last hand, \"727ak\" , contained a pair, or two of the same valued cards. To match this with a regular expression, one could use backreferences as such: >>> pair = re . compile ( r \".*(.).*\\1\" ) >>> displaymatch ( pair . match ( \"717ak\" )) # Pair of 7s. \"<Match: '717', groups=('7',)>\" >>> displaymatch ( pair . match ( \"718ak\" )) # No pairs. >>> displaymatch ( pair . match ( \"354aa\" )) # Pair of aces. \"<Match: '354aa', groups=('a',)>\" To find out what card the pair consists of, one could use the group() method of the match object in the following manner: >>> pair = re . compile ( r \".*(.).*\\1\" ) >>> pair . match ( \"717ak\" ) . group ( 1 ) '7' # Error because re.match() returns None, which doesn't have a group() method: >>> pair . match ( \"718ak\" ) . group ( 1 ) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<pyshell#23>\" , line 1 , in <module> re . match ( r \".*(.).*\\1\" , \"718ak\" ) . group ( 1 ) AttributeError : 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group' >>> pair . match ( \"354aa\" ) . group ( 1 ) 'a' Simulating scanf() Â¶ Python does not currently have an equivalent to scanf() . Regular expressions are generally more powerful, though also more verbose, than scanf() format strings. The table below offers some more-or-less equivalent mappings between scanf() format tokens and regular expressions. scanf() Token Regular Expression %c . %5c .{5} %d [-+]?\\d+ %e , %E , %f , %g [-+]?(\\d+(\\.\\d*)?|\\.\\d+)([eE][-+]?\\d+)? %i [-+]?(0[xX][\\dA-Fa-f]+|0[0-7]*|\\d+) %o [-+]?[0-7]+ %s \\S+ %u \\d+ %x , %X [-+]?(0[xX])?[\\dA-Fa-f]+ To extract the filename and numbers from a string like / usr / sbin / sendmail - 0 errors , 4 warnings you would use a scanf() format like % s - % d errors , % d warnings The equivalent regular expression would be ( \\ S + ) - ( \\ d + ) errors , ( \\ d + ) warnings search() vs. match() Â¶ Python offers different primitive operations based on regular expressions: re.match() checks for a match only at the beginning of the string re.search() checks for a match anywhere in the string (this is what Perl does by default) re.fullmatch() checks for entire string to be a match For example: >>> re . match ( \"c\" , \"abcdef\" ) # No match >>> re . search ( \"c\" , \"abcdef\" ) # Match <re.Match object; span=(2, 3), match='c'> >>> re . fullmatch ( \"p.*n\" , \"python\" ) # Match <re.Match object; span=(0, 6), match='python'> >>> re . fullmatch ( \"r.*n\" , \"python\" ) # No match Regular expressions beginning with '^' can be used with search() to restrict the match at the beginning of the string: >>> re . match ( \"c\" , \"abcdef\" ) # No match >>> re . search ( \"^c\" , \"abcdef\" ) # No match >>> re . search ( \"^a\" , \"abcdef\" ) # Match <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='a'> Note however that in MULTILINE mode match() only matches at the beginning of the string, whereas using search() with a regular expression beginning with '^' will match at the beginning of each line. >>> re . match ( \"X\" , \"A \\n B \\n X\" , re . MULTILINE ) # No match >>> re . search ( \"^X\" , \"A \\n B \\n X\" , re . MULTILINE ) # Match <re.Match object; span=(4, 5), match='X'> Making a Phonebook Â¶ split() splits a string into a list delimited by the passed pattern. The method is invaluable for converting textual data into data structures that can be easily read and modified by Python as demonstrated in the following example that creates a phonebook. First, here is the input. Normally it may come from a file, here we are using triple-quoted string syntax >>> text = \"\"\"Ross McFluff: 834.345.1254 155 Elm Street ... ... Ronald Heathmore: 892.345.3428 436 Finley Avenue ... Frank Burger: 925.541.7625 662 South Dogwood Way ... ... ... Heather Albrecht: 548.326.4584 919 Park Place\"\"\" The entries are separated by one or more newlines. Now we convert the string into a list with each nonempty line having its own entry: >>> entries = re . split ( \" \\n +\" , text ) >>> entries ['Ross McFluff: 834.345.1254 155 Elm Street', 'Ronald Heathmore: 892.345.3428 436 Finley Avenue', 'Frank Burger: 925.541.7625 662 South Dogwood Way', 'Heather Albrecht: 548.326.4584 919 Park Place'] Finally, split each entry into a list with first name, last name, telephone number, and address. We use the maxsplit parameter of split() because the address has spaces, our splitting pattern, in it: >>> [ re . split ( \":? \" , entry , maxsplit = 3 ) for entry in entries ] [['Ross', 'McFluff', '834.345.1254', '155 Elm Street'], ['Ronald', 'Heathmore', '892.345.3428', '436 Finley Avenue'], ['Frank', 'Burger', '925.541.7625', '662 South Dogwood Way'], ['Heather', 'Albrecht', '548.326.4584', '919 Park Place']] The :? pattern matches the colon after the last name, so that it does not occur in the result list. With a maxsplit of 4 , we could separate the house number from the street name: >>> [ re . split ( \":? \" , entry , maxsplit = 4 ) for entry in entries ] [['Ross', 'McFluff', '834.345.1254', '155', 'Elm Street'], ['Ronald', 'Heathmore', '892.345.3428', '436', 'Finley Avenue'], ['Frank', 'Burger', '925.541.7625', '662', 'South Dogwood Way'], ['Heather', 'Albrecht', '548.326.4584', '919', 'Park Place']] Text Munging Â¶ sub() replaces every occurrence of a pattern with a string or the result of a function. This example demonstrates using sub() with a function to âmungeâ text, or randomize the order of all the characters in each word of a sentence except for the first and last characters: >>> def repl ( m ): ... inner_word = list ( m . group ( 2 )) ... random . shuffle ( inner_word ) ... return m . group ( 1 ) + \"\" . join ( inner_word ) + m . group ( 3 ) ... >>> text = \"Professor Abdolmalek, please report your absences promptly.\" >>> re . sub ( r \"(\\w)(\\w+)(\\w)\" , repl , text ) 'Poefsrosr Aealmlobdk, pslaee reorpt your abnseces plmrptoy.' >>> re . sub ( r \"(\\w)(\\w+)(\\w)\" , repl , text ) 'Pofsroser Aodlambelk, plasee reoprt yuor asnebces potlmrpy.' Finding all Adverbs Â¶ findall() matches all occurrences of a pattern, not just the first one as search() does. For example, if a writer wanted to find all of the adverbs in some text, they might use findall() in the following manner: >>> text = \"He was carefully disguised but captured quickly by police.\" >>> re . findall ( r \"\\w+ly\\b\" , text ) ['carefully', 'quickly'] Finding all Adverbs and their Positions Â¶ If one wants more information about all matches of a pattern than the matched text, finditer() is useful as it provides Match objects instead of strings. Continuing with the previous example, if a writer wanted to find all of the adverbs and their positions in some text, they would use finditer() in the following manner: >>> text = \"He was carefully disguised but captured quickly by police.\" >>> for m in re . finditer ( r \"\\w+ly\\b\" , text ): ... print ( ' %02d - %02d : %s ' % ( m . start (), m . end (), m . group ( 0 ))) 07-16: carefully 40-47: quickly Raw String Notation Â¶ Raw string notation ( r\"text\" ) keeps regular expressions sane. Without it, every backslash ( '\\' ) in a regular expression would have to be prefixed with another one to escape it. For example, the two following lines of code are functionally identical: >>> re . match ( r \"\\W(.)\\1\\W\" , \" ff \" ) <re.Match object; span=(0, 4), match=' ff '> >>> re . match ( \" \\\\ W(.) \\\\ 1 \\\\ W\" , \" ff \" ) <re.Match object; span=(0, 4), match=' ff '> When one wants to match a literal backslash, it must be escaped in the regular expression. With raw string notation, this means r\"\\\\\" . Without raw string notation, one must use \"\\\\\\\\\" , making the following lines of code functionally identical: >>> re . match ( r \" \\\\ \" , r \" \\\\ \" ) <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='\\\\'> >>> re . match ( \" \\\\\\\\ \" , r \" \\\\ \" ) <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='\\\\'> Writing a Tokenizer Â¶ A tokenizer or scanner analyzes a string to categorize groups of characters. This is a useful first step in writing a compiler or interpreter. The text categories are specified with regular expressions. The technique is to combine those into a single master regular expression and to loop over successive matches: from typing import NamedTuple import re class Token ( NamedTuple ): type : str value : str line : int column : int def tokenize ( code ): keywords = { 'IF' , 'THEN' , 'ENDIF' , 'FOR' , 'NEXT' , 'GOSUB' , 'RETURN' } token_specification = [ ( 'NUMBER' , r '\\d+(\\.\\d*)?' ), # Integer or decimal number ( 'ASSIGN' , r ':=' ), # Assignment operator ( 'END' , r ';' ), # Statement terminator ( 'ID' , r '[A-Za-z]+' ), # Identifiers ( 'OP' , r '[+\\-*/]' ), # Arithmetic operators ( 'NEWLINE' , r '\\n' ), # Line endings ( 'SKIP' , r '[ \\t]+' ), # Skip over spaces and tabs ( 'MISMATCH' , r '.' ), # Any other character ] tok_regex = '|' . join ( '(?P< %s > %s )' % pair for pair in token_specification ) line_num = 1 line_start = 0 for mo in re . finditer ( tok_regex , code ): kind = mo . lastgroup value = mo . group () column = mo . start () - line_start if kind == 'NUMBER' : value = float ( value ) if '.' in value else int ( value ) elif kind == 'ID' and value in keywords : kind = value elif kind == 'NEWLINE' : line_start = mo . end () line_num += 1 continue elif kind == 'SKIP' : continue elif kind == 'MISMATCH' : raise RuntimeError ( f ' { value !r} unexpected on line { line_num } ' ) yield Token ( kind , value , line_num , column ) statements = ''' IF quantity THEN total := total + price * quantity; tax := price * 0.05; ENDIF; ''' for token in tokenize ( statements ): print ( token ) The tokenizer produces the following output: Token ( type = 'IF' , value = 'IF' , line = 2 , column = 4 ) Token ( type = 'ID' , value = 'quantity' , line = 2 , column = 7 ) Token ( type = 'THEN' , value = 'THEN' , line = 2 , column = 16 ) Token ( type = 'ID' , value = 'total' , line = 3 , column = 8 ) Token ( type = 'ASSIGN' , value = ':=' , line = 3 , column = 14 ) Token ( type = 'ID' , value = 'total' , line = 3 , column = 17 ) Token ( type = 'OP' , value = '+' , line = 3 , column = 23 ) Token ( type = 'ID' , value = 'price' , line = 3 , column = 25 ) Token ( type = 'OP' , value = '*' , line = 3 , column = 31 ) Token ( type = 'ID' , value = 'quantity' , line = 3 , column = 33 ) Token ( type = 'END' , value = ';' , line = 3 , column = 41 ) Token ( type = 'ID' , value = 'tax' , line = 4 , column = 8 ) Token ( type = 'ASSIGN' , value = ':=' , line = 4 , column = 12 ) Token ( type = 'ID' , value = 'price' , line = 4 , column = 15 ) Token ( type = 'OP' , value = '*' , line = 4 , column = 21 ) Token ( type = 'NUMBER' , value = 0.05 , line = 4 , column = 23 ) Token ( type = 'END' , value = ';' , line = 4 , column = 27 ) Token ( type = 'ENDIF' , value = 'ENDIF' , line = 5 , column = 4 ) Token ( type = 'END' , value = ';' , line = 5 , column = 9 ) [ Frie09 ] Friedl, Jeffrey.

      "text_content": "difflib â Helpers for computing deltas Â¶ Source code: Lib/difflib.py This module provides classes and functions for comparing sequences. It can be used for example, for comparing files, and can produce information about file differences in various formats, including HTML and context and unified diffs. For comparing directories and files, see also, the filecmp module. class difflib. SequenceMatcher This is a flexible class for comparing pairs of sequences of any type, so long as the sequence elements are hashable . The basic algorithm predates, and is a little fancier than, an algorithm published in the late 1980âs by Ratcliff and Obershelp under the hyperbolic name âgestalt pattern matching.â The idea is to find the longest contiguous matching subsequence that contains no âjunkâ elements; these âjunkâ elements are ones that are uninteresting in some sense, such as blank lines or whitespace. (Handling junk is an extension to the Ratcliff and Obershelp algorithm.) The same idea is then applied recursively to the pieces of the sequences to the left and to the right of the matching subsequence. This does not yield minimal edit sequences, but does tend to yield matches that âlook rightâ to people. Timing: The basic Ratcliff-Obershelp algorithm is cubic time in the worst case and quadratic time in the expected case. SequenceMatcher is quadratic time for the worst case and has expected-case behavior dependent in a complicated way on how many elements the sequences have in common; best case time is linear. Automatic junk heuristic: SequenceMatcher supports a heuristic that automatically treats certain sequence items as junk. The heuristic counts how many times each individual item appears in the sequence. If an itemâs duplicates (after the first one) account for more than 1% of the sequence and the sequence is at least 200 items long, this item is marked as âpopularâ and is treated as junk for the purpose of sequence matching. This heuristic can be turned off by setting the autojunk argument to False when creating the SequenceMatcher . Changed in version 3.2: Added the autojunk parameter. class difflib. Differ Â¶ This is a class for comparing sequences of lines of text, and producing human-readable differences or deltas. Differ uses SequenceMatcher both to compare sequences of lines, and to compare sequences of characters within similar (near-matching) lines. Each line of a Differ delta begins with a two-letter code: Code Meaning '- ' line unique to sequence 1 '+ ' line unique to sequence 2 ' ' line common to both sequences '? ' line not present in either input sequence Lines beginning with â ? â attempt to guide the eye to intraline differences, and were not present in either input sequence. These lines can be confusing if the sequences contain whitespace characters, such as spaces, tabs or line breaks. class difflib. HtmlDiff Â¶ This class can be used to create an HTML table (or a complete HTML file containing the table) showing a side by side, line by line comparison of text with inter-line and intra-line change highlights. The table can be generated in either full or contextual difference mode. The constructor for this class is: __init__ ( tabsize = 8 , wrapcolumn = None , linejunk = None , charjunk = IS_CHARACTER_JUNK ) Â¶ Initializes instance of HtmlDiff . tabsize is an optional keyword argument to specify tab stop spacing and defaults to 8 . wrapcolumn is an optional keyword to specify column number where lines are broken and wrapped, defaults to None where lines are not wrapped. linejunk and charjunk are optional keyword arguments passed into ndiff() (used by HtmlDiff to generate the side by side HTML differences). See ndiff() documentation for argument default values and descriptions. The following methods are public: make_file ( fromlines , tolines , fromdesc = '' , todesc = '' , context = False , numlines = 5 , * , charset = 'utf-8' ) Â¶ Compares fromlines and tolines (lists of strings) and returns a string which is a complete HTML file containing a table showing line by line differences with inter-line and intra-line changes highlighted. fromdesc and todesc are optional keyword arguments to specify from/to file column header strings (both default to an empty string). context and numlines are both optional keyword arguments. Set context to True when contextual differences are to be shown, else the default is False to show the full files. numlines defaults to 5 . When context is True numlines controls the number of context lines which surround the difference highlights. When context is False numlines controls the number of lines which are shown before a difference highlight when using the ânextâ hyperlinks (setting to zero would cause the ânextâ hyperlinks to place the next difference highlight at the top of the browser without any leading context). Note fromdesc and todesc are interpreted as unescaped HTML and should be properly escaped while receiving input from untrusted sources. Changed in version 3.5: charset keyword-only argument was added. The default charset of HTML document changed from 'ISO-8859-1' to 'utf-8' . make_table ( fromlines , tolines , fromdesc = '' , todesc = '' , context = False , numlines = 5 ) Â¶ Compares fromlines and tolines (lists of strings) and returns a string which is a complete HTML table showing line by line differences with inter-line and intra-line changes highlighted. The arguments for this method are the same as those for the make_file() method. difflib. context_diff ( a , b , fromfile = '' , tofile = '' , fromfiledate = '' , tofiledate = '' , n = 3 , lineterm = '\\n' ) Â¶ Compare a and b (lists of strings); return a delta (a generator generating the delta lines) in context diff format. Context diffs are a compact way of showing just the lines that have changed plus a few lines of context. The changes are shown in a before/after style. The number of context lines is set by n which defaults to three. By default, the diff control lines (those with *** or --- ) are created with a trailing newline. This is helpful so that inputs created from io.IOBase.readlines() result in diffs that are suitable for use with io.IOBase.writelines() since both the inputs and outputs have trailing newlines. For inputs that do not have trailing newlines, set the lineterm argument to \"\" so that the output will be uniformly newline free. The context diff format normally has a header for filenames and modification times. Any or all of these may be specified using strings for fromfile , tofile , fromfiledate , and tofiledate . The modification times are normally expressed in the ISO 8601 format. If not specified, the strings default to blanks. >>> import sys >>> from difflib import * >>> s1 = [ 'bacon \\n ' , 'eggs \\n ' , 'ham \\n ' , 'guido \\n ' ] >>> s2 = [ 'python \\n ' , 'eggy \\n ' , 'hamster \\n ' , 'guido \\n ' ] >>> sys . stdout . writelines ( context_diff ( s1 , s2 , fromfile = 'before.py' , ... tofile = 'after.py' )) *** before.py --- after.py *************** *** 1,4 **** ! bacon ! eggs ! ham guido --- 1,4 ---- ! python ! eggy ! hamster guido See A command-line interface to difflib for a more detailed example. difflib. get_close_matches ( word , possibilities , n = 3 , cutoff = 0.6 ) Â¶ Return a list of the best âgood enoughâ matches. word is a sequence for which close matches are desired (typically a string), and possibilities is a list of sequences against which to match word (typically a list of strings). Optional argument n (default 3 ) is the maximum number of close matches to return; n must be greater than 0 . Optional argument cutoff (default 0.6 ) is a float in the range [0, 1]. Possibilities that donât score at least that similar to word are ignored. The best (no more than n ) matches among the possibilities are returned in a list, sorted by similarity score, most similar first. >>> get_close_matches ( 'appel' , [ 'ape' , 'apple' , 'peach' , 'puppy' ]) ['apple', 'ape'] >>> import keyword >>> get_close_matches ( 'wheel' , keyword . kwlist ) ['while'] >>> get_close_matches ( 'pineapple' , keyword . kwlist ) [] >>> get_close_matches ( 'accept' , keyword . kwlist ) ['except'] difflib. ndiff ( a , b , linejunk = None , charjunk = IS_CHARACTER_JUNK ) Â¶ Compare a and b (lists of strings); return a Differ -style delta (a generator generating the delta lines). Optional keyword parameters linejunk and charjunk are filtering functions (or None ): linejunk : A function that accepts a single string argument, and returns true if the string is junk, or false if not. The default is None . There is also a module-level function IS_LINE_JUNK() , which filters out lines without visible characters, except for at most one hash character ( '#' ) â however the underlying SequenceMatcher class does a dynamic analysis of which lines are so frequent as to constitute noise, and this usually works better than using this function. charjunk : A function that accepts a character (a string of length 1), and returns if the character is junk, or false if not. The default is module-level function IS_CHARACTER_JUNK() , which filters out whitespace characters (a blank or tab; itâs a bad idea to include newline in this!). >>> diff = ndiff ( 'one \\n two \\n three \\n ' . splitlines ( keepends = True ), ... 'ore \\n tree \\n emu \\n ' . splitlines ( keepends = True )) >>> print ( '' . join ( diff ), end = \"\" ) - one ? ^ + ore ? ^ - two - three ? - + tree + emu difflib. restore ( sequence , which ) Â¶ Return one of the two sequences that generated a delta. Given a sequence produced by Differ.compare() or ndiff() , extract lines originating from file 1 or 2 (parameter which ), stripping off line prefixes. Example: >>> diff = ndiff ( 'one \\n two \\n three \\n ' . splitlines ( keepends = True ), ... 'ore \\n tree \\n emu \\n ' . splitlines ( keepends = True )) >>> diff = list ( diff ) # materialize the generated delta into a list >>> print ( '' . join ( restore ( diff , 1 )), end = \"\" ) one two three >>> print ( '' . join ( restore ( diff , 2 )), end = \"\" ) ore tree emu difflib. unified_diff ( a , b , fromfile = '' , tofile = '' , fromfiledate = '' , tofiledate = '' , n = 3 , lineterm = '\\n' ) Â¶ Compare a and b (lists of strings); return a delta (a generator generating the delta lines) in unified diff format. Unified diffs are a compact way of showing just the lines that have changed plus a few lines of context. The changes are shown in an inline style (instead of separate before/after blocks). The number of context lines is set by n which defaults to three. By default, the diff control lines (those with --- , +++ , or @@ ) are created with a trailing newline. This is helpful so that inputs created from io.IOBase.readlines() result in diffs that are suitable for use with io.IOBase.writelines() since both the inputs and outputs have trailing newlines. For inputs that do not have trailing newlines, set the lineterm argument to \"\" so that the output will be uniformly newline free. The unified diff format normally has a header for filenames and modification times. Any or all of these may be specified using strings for fromfile , tofile , fromfiledate , and tofiledate . The modification times are normally expressed in the ISO 8601 format. If not specified, the strings default to blanks. >>> s1 = [ 'bacon \\n ' , 'eggs \\n ' , 'ham \\n ' , 'guido \\n ' ] >>> s2 = [ 'python \\n ' , 'eggy \\n ' , 'hamster \\n ' , 'guido \\n ' ] >>> sys . stdout . writelines ( unified_diff ( s1 , s2 , fromfile = 'before.py' , tofile = 'after.py' )) --- before.py +++ after.py @@ -1,4 +1,4 @@ -bacon -eggs -ham +python +eggy +hamster guido See A command-line interface to difflib for a more detailed example. difflib. diff_bytes ( dfunc , a , b , fromfile = b'' , tofile = b'' , fromfiledate = b'' , tofiledate = b'' , n = 3 , lineterm = b'\\n' ) Â¶ Compare a and b (lists of bytes objects) using dfunc ; yield a sequence of delta lines (also bytes) in the format returned by dfunc . dfunc must be a callable, typically either unified_diff() or context_diff() . Allows you to compare data with unknown or inconsistent encoding. All inputs except n must be bytes objects, not str. Works by losslessly converting all inputs (except n ) to str, and calling dfunc(a, b, fromfile, tofile, fromfiledate, tofiledate, n, lineterm) . The output of dfunc is then converted back to bytes, so the delta lines that you receive have the same unknown/inconsistent encodings as a and b . Added in version 3.5. difflib. IS_LINE_JUNK ( line ) Â¶ Return True for ignorable lines. The line line is ignorable if line is blank or contains a single '#' , otherwise it is not ignorable. Used as a default for parameter linejunk in ndiff() in older versions. difflib. IS_CHARACTER_JUNK ( ch ) Â¶ Return True for ignorable characters. The character ch is ignorable if ch is a space or tab, otherwise it is not ignorable. Used as a default for parameter charjunk in ndiff() . See also Pattern Matching: The Gestalt Approach Discussion of a similar algorithm by John W. Ratcliff and D. E. Metzener. This was published in Dr. Dobbâs Journal in July, 1988. SequenceMatcher Objects Â¶ The SequenceMatcher class has this constructor: class difflib. SequenceMatcher ( isjunk = None , a = '' , b = '' , autojunk = True ) Â¶ Optional argument isjunk must be None (the default) or a one-argument function that takes a sequence element and returns true if and only if the element is âjunkâ and should be ignored. Passing None for isjunk is equivalent to passing lambda x: False ; in other words, no elements are ignored. For example, pass: lambda x : x in \" \\t \" if youâre comparing lines as sequences of characters, and donât want to synch up on blanks or hard tabs. The optional arguments a and b are sequences to be compared; both default to empty strings. The elements of both sequences must be hashable . The optional argument autojunk can be used to disable the automatic junk heuristic. Changed in version 3.2: Added the autojunk parameter. SequenceMatcher objects get three data attributes: bjunk is the set of elements of b for which isjunk is True ; bpopular is the set of non-junk elements considered popular by the heuristic (if it is not disabled); b2j is a dict mapping the remaining elements of b to a list of positions where they occur. All three are reset whenever b is reset with set_seqs() or set_seq2() . Added in version 3.2: The bjunk and bpopular attributes. SequenceMatcher objects have the following methods: set_seqs ( a , b ) Â¶ Set the two sequences to be compared. SequenceMatcher computes and caches detailed information about the second sequence, so if you want to compare one sequence against many sequences, use set_seq2() to set the commonly used sequence once and call set_seq1() repeatedly, once for each of the other sequences. set_seq1 ( a ) Â¶ Set the first sequence to be compared. The second sequence to be compared is not changed. set_seq2 ( b ) Â¶ Set the second sequence to be compared. The first sequence to be compared is not changed. find_longest_match ( alo = 0 , ahi = None , blo = 0 , bhi = None ) Â¶ Find longest matching block in a[alo:ahi] and b[blo:bhi] . If isjunk was omitted or None , find_longest_match() returns (i, j, k) such that a[i:i+k] is equal to b[j:j+k] , where alo <= i <= i+k <= ahi and blo <= j <= j+k <= bhi . For all (i', j', k') meeting those conditions, the additional conditions k >= k' , i <= i' , and if i == i' , j <= j' are also met. In other words, of all maximal matching blocks, return one that starts earliest in a , and of all those maximal matching blocks that start earliest in a , return the one that starts earliest in b . >>> s = SequenceMatcher ( None , \" abcd\" , \"abcd abcd\" ) >>> s . find_longest_match ( 0 , 5 , 0 , 9 ) Match(a=0, b=4, size=5) If isjunk was provided, first the longest matching block is determined as above, but with the additional restriction that no junk element appears in the block. Then that block is extended as far as possible by matching (only) junk elements on both sides. So the resulting block never matches on junk except as identical junk happens to be adjacent to an interesting match. Hereâs the same example as before, but considering blanks to be junk. That prevents ' abcd' from matching the ' abcd' at the tail end of the second sequence directly. Instead only the 'abcd' can match, and matches the leftmost 'abcd' in the second sequence: >>> s = SequenceMatcher ( lambda x : x == \" \" , \" abcd\" , \"abcd abcd\" ) >>> s . find_longest_match ( 0 , 5 , 0 , 9 ) Match(a=1, b=0, size=4) If no blocks match, this returns (alo, blo, 0) . This method returns a named tuple Match(a, b, size) . Changed in version 3.9: Added default arguments. get_matching_blocks ( ) Â¶ Return list of triples describing non-overlapping matching subsequences. Each triple is of the form (i, j, n) , and means that a[i:i+n] == b[j:j+n] . The triples are monotonically increasing in i and j . The last triple is a dummy, and has the value (len(a), len(b), 0) . It is the only triple with n == 0 . If (i, j, n) and (i', j', n') are adjacent triples in the list, and the second is not the last triple in the list, then i+n < i' or j+n < j' ; in other words, adjacent triples always describe non-adjacent equal blocks. >>> s = SequenceMatcher ( None , \"abxcd\" , \"abcd\" ) >>> s . get_matching_blocks () [Match(a=0, b=0, size=2), Match(a=3, b=2, size=2), Match(a=5, b=4, size=0)] get_opcodes ( ) Â¶ Return list of 5-tuples describing how to turn a into b . Each tuple is of the form (tag, i1, i2, j1, j2) . The first tuple has i1 == j1 == 0 , and remaining tuples have i1 equal to the i2 from the preceding tuple, and, likewise, j1 equal to the previous j2 . The tag values are strings, with these meanings: Value Meaning 'replace' a[i1:i2] should be replaced by b[j1:j2] . 'delete' a[i1:i2] should be deleted. Note that j1 == j2 in this case. 'insert' b[j1:j2] should be inserted at a[i1:i1] . Note that i1 == i2 in this case. 'equal' a[i1:i2] == b[j1:j2] (the sub-sequences are equal). For example: >>> a = \"qabxcd\" >>> b = \"abycdf\" >>> s = SequenceMatcher ( None , a , b ) >>> for tag , i1 , i2 , j1 , j2 in s . get_opcodes (): ... print ( ' {:7} a[ {} : {} ] --> b[ {} : {} ] {!r:>8} --> {!r} ' . format ( ... tag , i1 , i2 , j1 , j2 , a [ i1 : i2 ], b [ j1 : j2 ])) delete a[0:1] --> b[0:0] 'q' --> '' equal a[1:3] --> b[0:2] 'ab' --> 'ab' replace a[3:4] --> b[2:3] 'x' --> 'y' equal a[4:6] --> b[3:5] 'cd' --> 'cd' insert a[6:6] --> b[5:6] '' --> 'f' get_grouped_opcodes ( n = 3 ) Â¶ Return a generator of groups with up to n lines of context. Starting with the groups returned by get_opcodes() , this method splits out smaller change clusters and eliminates intervening ranges which have no changes. The groups are returned in the same format as get_opcodes() . ratio ( ) Â¶ Return a measure of the sequencesâ similarity as a float in the range [0, 1]. Where T is the total number of elements in both sequences, and M is the number of matches, this is 2.0*M / T. Note that this is 1.0 if the sequences are identical, and 0.0 if they have nothing in common. This is expensive to compute if get_matching_blocks() or get_opcodes() hasnât already been called, in which case you may want to try quick_ratio() or real_quick_ratio() first to get an upper bound. Note Caution: The result of a ratio() call may depend on the order of the arguments. For instance: >>> SequenceMatcher ( None , 'tide' , 'diet' ) . ratio () 0.25 >>> SequenceMatcher ( None , 'diet' , 'tide' ) . ratio () 0.5 quick_ratio ( ) Â¶ Return an upper bound on ratio() relatively quickly. real_quick_ratio ( ) Â¶ Return an upper bound on ratio() very quickly. The three methods that return the ratio of matching to total characters can give different results due to differing levels of approximation, although quick_ratio() and real_quick_ratio() are always at least as large as ratio() : >>> s = SequenceMatcher ( None , \"abcd\" , \"bcde\" ) >>> s . ratio () 0.75 >>> s . quick_ratio () 0.75 >>> s . real_quick_ratio () 1.0 SequenceMatcher Examples Â¶ This example compares two strings, considering blanks to be âjunkâ: >>> s = SequenceMatcher ( lambda x : x == \" \" , ... \"private Thread currentThread;\" , ... \"private volatile Thread currentThread;\" ) ratio() returns a float in [0, 1], measuring the similarity of the sequences. As a rule of thumb, a ratio() value over 0.6 means the sequences are close matches: >>> print ( round ( s . ratio (), 3 )) 0.866 If youâre only interested in where the sequences match, get_matching_blocks() is handy: >>> for block in s . get_matching_blocks (): ... print ( \"a[ %d ] and b[ %d ] match for %d elements\" % block ) a[0] and b[0] match for 8 elements a[8] and b[17] match for 21 elements a[29] and b[38] match for 0 elements Note that the last tuple returned by get_matching_blocks() is always a dummy, (len(a), len(b), 0) , and this is the only case in which the last tuple element (number of elements matched) is 0 . If you want to know how to change the first sequence into the second, use get_opcodes() : >>> for opcode in s . get_opcodes (): ... print ( \" %6s a[ %d : %d ] b[ %d : %d ]\" % opcode ) equal a[0:8] b[0:8] insert a[8:8] b[8:17] equal a[8:29] b[17:38] See also The get_close_matches() function in this module which shows how simple code building on SequenceMatcher can be used to do useful work. Simple version control recipe for a small application built with SequenceMatcher . Differ Objects Â¶ Note that Differ -generated deltas make no claim to be minimal diffs. To the contrary, minimal diffs are often counter-intuitive, because they synch up anywhere possible, sometimes accidental matches 100 pages apart. Restricting synch points to contiguous matches preserves some notion of locality, at the occasional cost of producing a longer diff. The Differ class has this constructor: class difflib. Differ ( linejunk = None , charjunk = None ) Optional keyword parameters linejunk and charjunk are for filter functions (or None ): linejunk : A function that accepts a single string argument, and returns true if the string is junk. The default is None , meaning that no line is considered junk. charjunk : A function that accepts a single character argument (a string of length 1), and returns true if the character is junk. The default is None , meaning that no character is considered junk. These junk-filtering functions speed up matching to find differences and do not cause any differing lines or characters to be ignored. Read the description of the find_longest_match() methodâs isjunk parameter for an explanation. Differ objects are used (deltas generated) via a single method: compare ( a , b ) Â¶ Compare two sequences of lines, and generate the delta (a sequence of lines). Each sequence must contain individual single-line strings ending with newlines. Such sequences can be obtained from the readlines() method of file-like objects. The delta generated also consists of newline-terminated strings, ready to be printed as-is via the writelines() method of a file-like object. Differ Example Â¶ This example compares two texts. First we set up the texts, sequences of individual single-line strings ending with newlines (such sequences can also be obtained from the readlines() method of file-like objects): >>> text1 = ''' 1. Beautiful is better than ugly. ... 2. Explicit is better than implicit. ... 3. Simple is better than complex. ... 4. Complex is better than complicated. ... ''' . splitlines ( keepends = True ) >>> len ( text1 ) 4 >>> text1 [ 0 ][ - 1 ] '\\n' >>> text2 = ''' 1. Beautiful is better than ugly. ... 3. Simple is better than complex. ... 4. Complicated is better than complex. ... 5. Flat is better than nested. ... ''' . splitlines ( keepends = True ) Next we instantiate a Differ object: >>> d = Differ () Note that when instantiating a Differ object we may pass functions to filter out line and character âjunk.â See the Differ() constructor for details. Finally, we compare the two: >>> result = list ( d . compare ( text1 , text2 )) result is a list of strings, so letâs pretty-print it: >>> from pprint import pprint >>> pprint ( result ) [' 1. Beautiful is better than ugly.\\n', '- 2. Explicit is better than implicit.\\n', '- 3. Simple is better than complex.\\n', '+ 3. Simple is better than complex.\\n', '? ++\\n', '- 4. Complex is better than complicated.\\n', '? ^ ---- ^\\n', '+ 4. Complicated is better than complex.\\n', '? ++++ ^ ^\\n', '+ 5. Flat is better than nested.\\n'] As a single multi-line string it looks like this: >>> import sys >>> sys . stdout . writelines ( result ) 1. Beautiful is better than ugly. - 2. Explicit is better than implicit. - 3. Simple is better than complex. + 3. Simple is better than complex. ? ++ - 4. Complex is better than complicated. ? ^ ---- ^ + 4. Complicated is better than complex. ? ++++ ^ ^ + 5. Flat is better than nested.

      "text_content": "textwrap â Text wrapping and filling Â¶ Source code: Lib/textwrap.py The textwrap module provides some convenience functions, as well as TextWrapper , the class that does all the work. If youâre just wrapping or filling one or two text strings, the convenience functions should be good enough; otherwise, you should use an instance of TextWrapper for efficiency. textwrap. wrap ( text , width = 70 , * , initial_indent = '' , subsequent_indent = '' , expand_tabs = True , replace_whitespace = True , fix_sentence_endings = False , break_long_words = True , drop_whitespace = True , break_on_hyphens = True , tabsize = 8 , max_lines = None , placeholder = ' [...]' ) Â¶ Wraps the single paragraph in text (a string) so every line is at most width characters long. Returns a list of output lines, without final newlines. Optional keyword arguments correspond to the instance attributes of TextWrapper , documented below. See the TextWrapper.wrap() method for additional details on how wrap() behaves. textwrap. fill ( text , width = 70 , * , initial_indent = '' , subsequent_indent = '' , expand_tabs = True , replace_whitespace = True , fix_sentence_endings = False , break_long_words = True , drop_whitespace = True , break_on_hyphens = True , tabsize = 8 , max_lines = None , placeholder = ' [...]' ) Â¶ Wraps the single paragraph in text , and returns a single string containing the wrapped paragraph. fill() is shorthand for \" \\n \" . join ( wrap ( text , ... )) In particular, fill() accepts exactly the same keyword arguments as wrap() . textwrap. shorten ( text , width , * , fix_sentence_endings = False , break_long_words = True , break_on_hyphens = True , placeholder = ' [...]' ) Â¶ Collapse and truncate the given text to fit in the given width . First the whitespace in text is collapsed (all whitespace is replaced by single spaces). If the result fits in the width , it is returned. Otherwise, enough words are dropped from the end so that the remaining words plus the placeholder fit within width : >>> textwrap . shorten ( \"Hello world!\" , width = 12 ) 'Hello world!' >>> textwrap . shorten ( \"Hello world!\" , width = 11 ) 'Hello [...]' >>> textwrap . shorten ( \"Hello world\" , width = 10 , placeholder = \"...\" ) 'Hello...' Optional keyword arguments correspond to the instance attributes of TextWrapper , documented below. Note that the whitespace is collapsed before the text is passed to the TextWrapper fill() function, so changing the value of tabsize , expand_tabs , drop_whitespace , and replace_whitespace will have no effect. Added in version 3.4. textwrap. dedent ( text ) Â¶ Remove any common leading whitespace from every line in text . This can be used to make triple-quoted strings line up with the left edge of the display, while still presenting them in the source code in indented form. Note that tabs and spaces are both treated as whitespace, but they are not equal: the lines \" hello\" and \"\\thello\" are considered to have no common leading whitespace. Lines containing only whitespace are ignored in the input and normalized to a single newline character in the output. For example: def test (): # end first line with \\ to avoid the empty line! s = ''' \\ hello world ''' print ( repr ( s )) # prints ' hello\\n world\\n ' print ( repr ( dedent ( s ))) # prints 'hello\\n world\\n' Changed in version 3.14: The dedent() function now correctly normalizes blank lines containing only whitespace characters. Previously, the implementation only normalized blank lines containing tabs and spaces. textwrap. indent ( text , prefix , predicate = None ) Â¶ Add prefix to the beginning of selected lines in text . Lines are separated by calling text.splitlines(True) . By default, prefix is added to all lines that do not consist solely of whitespace (including any line endings). For example: >>> s = 'hello \\n\\n \\n world' >>> indent ( s , ' ' ) ' hello\\n\\n \\n world' The optional predicate argument can be used to control which lines are indented. For example, it is easy to add prefix to even empty and whitespace-only lines: >>> print ( indent ( s , '+ ' , lambda line : True )) + hello + + + world Added in version 3.3. wrap() , fill() and shorten() work by creating a TextWrapper instance and calling a single method on it. That instance is not reused, so for applications that process many text strings using wrap() and/or fill() , it may be more efficient to create your own TextWrapper object. Text is preferably wrapped on whitespaces and right after the hyphens in hyphenated words; only then will long words be broken if necessary, unless TextWrapper.break_long_words is set to false. class textwrap. TextWrapper ( ** kwargs ) Â¶ The TextWrapper constructor accepts a number of optional keyword arguments. Each keyword argument corresponds to an instance attribute, so for example wrapper = TextWrapper ( initial_indent = \"* \" ) is the same as wrapper = TextWrapper () wrapper . initial_indent = \"* \" You can reuse the same TextWrapper object many times, and you can change any of its options through direct assignment to instance attributes between uses. The TextWrapper instance attributes (and keyword arguments to the constructor) are as follows: width Â¶ (default: 70 ) The maximum length of wrapped lines. As long as there are no individual words in the input text longer than width , TextWrapper guarantees that no output line will be longer than width characters. expand_tabs Â¶ (default: True ) If true, then all tab characters in text will be expanded to spaces using the expandtabs() method of text . tabsize Â¶ (default: 8 ) If expand_tabs is true, then all tab characters in text will be expanded to zero or more spaces, depending on the current column and the given tab size. Added in version 3.3. replace_whitespace Â¶ (default: True ) If true, after tab expansion but before wrapping, the wrap() method will replace each whitespace character with a single space. The whitespace characters replaced are as follows: tab, newline, vertical tab, formfeed, and carriage return ( '\\t\\n\\v\\f\\r' ). Note If expand_tabs is false and replace_whitespace is true, each tab character will be replaced by a single space, which is not the same as tab expansion. Note If replace_whitespace is false, newlines may appear in the middle of a line and cause strange output. For this reason, text should be split into paragraphs (using str.splitlines() or similar) which are wrapped separately. drop_whitespace Â¶ (default: True ) If true, whitespace at the beginning and ending of every line (after wrapping but before indenting) is dropped. Whitespace at the beginning of the paragraph, however, is not dropped if non-whitespace follows it. If whitespace being dropped takes up an entire line, the whole line is dropped. initial_indent Â¶ (default: '' ) String that will be prepended to the first line of wrapped output. Counts towards the length of the first line. The empty string is not indented. subsequent_indent Â¶ (default: '' ) String that will be prepended to all lines of wrapped output except the first. Counts towards the length of each line except the first. fix_sentence_endings Â¶ (default: False ) If true, TextWrapper attempts to detect sentence endings and ensure that sentences are always separated by exactly two spaces. This is generally desired for text in a monospaced font. However, the sentence detection algorithm is imperfect: it assumes that a sentence ending consists of a lowercase letter followed by one of '.' , '!' , or '?' , possibly followed by one of '\"' or \"'\" , followed by a space. One problem with this algorithm is that it is unable to detect the difference between âDr.â in [ ... ] Dr . Frankenstein 's monster [...] and âSpot.â in [ ... ] See Spot . See Spot run [ ... ] fix_sentence_endings is false by default. Since the sentence detection algorithm relies on string.lowercase for the definition of âlowercase letterâ, and a convention of using two spaces after a period to separate sentences on the same line, it is specific to English-language texts. break_long_words Â¶ (default: True ) If true, then words longer than width will be broken in order to ensure that no lines are longer than width . If it is false, long words will not be broken, and some lines may be longer than width . (Long words will be put on a line by themselves, in order to minimize the amount by which width is exceeded.) break_on_hyphens Â¶ (default: True ) If true, wrapping will occur preferably on whitespaces and right after hyphens in compound words, as it is customary in English. If false, only whitespaces will be considered as potentially good places for line breaks, but you need to set break_long_words to false if you want truly insecable words. Default behaviour in previous versions was to always allow breaking hyphenated words. max_lines Â¶ (default: None ) If not None , then the output will contain at most max_lines lines, with placeholder appearing at the end of the output. Added in version 3.4. placeholder Â¶ (default: ' [...]' ) String that will appear at the end of the output text if it has been truncated. Added in version 3.4. TextWrapper also provides some public methods, analogous to the module-level convenience functions: wrap ( text ) Â¶ Wraps the single paragraph in text (a string) so every line is at most width characters long. All wrapping options are taken from instance attributes of the TextWrapper instance. Returns a list of output lines, without final newlines. If the wrapped output has no content, the returned list is empty. fill ( text ) Â¶ Wraps the single paragraph in text , and returns a single string containing the wrapped paragraph.",

      "text_content": "unicodedata â Unicode Database Â¶ This module provides access to the Unicode Character Database (UCD) which defines character properties for all Unicode characters. The data contained in this database is compiled from the UCD version 16.0.0 . The module uses the same names and symbols as defined by Unicode Standard Annex #44, âUnicode Character Databaseâ . It defines the following functions: See also The Unicode HOWTO for more information about Unicode and how to use this module. unicodedata. lookup ( name ) Â¶ Look up character by name. If a character with the given name is found, return the corresponding character. If not found, KeyError is raised. For example: >>> unicodedata . lookup ( 'LEFT CURLY BRACKET' ) '{' The characters returned by this function are the same as those produced by \\N escape sequence in string literals. For example: >>> unicodedata . lookup ( 'MIDDLE DOT' ) == ' \\N{MIDDLE DOT} ' True Changed in version 3.3: Support for name aliases [ 1 ] and named sequences [ 2 ] has been added. unicodedata. name ( chr , default = None , / ) Â¶ Returns the name assigned to the character chr as a string. If no name is defined, default is returned, or, if not given, ValueError is raised. For example: >>> unicodedata . name ( 'Â½' ) 'VULGAR FRACTION ONE HALF' >>> unicodedata . name ( ' \\uFFFF ' , 'fallback' ) 'fallback' unicodedata. decimal ( chr , default = None , / ) Â¶ Returns the decimal value assigned to the character chr as integer. If no such value is defined, default is returned, or, if not given, ValueError is raised. For example: >>> unicodedata . decimal ( ' \\N{ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT NINE} ' ) 9 >>> unicodedata . decimal ( ' \\N{SUPERSCRIPT NINE} ' , - 1 ) -1 unicodedata. digit ( chr , default = None , / ) Â¶ Returns the digit value assigned to the character chr as integer. If no such value is defined, default is returned, or, if not given, ValueError is raised: >>> unicodedata . digit ( ' \\N{SUPERSCRIPT NINE} ' ) 9 unicodedata. numeric ( chr , default = None , / ) Â¶ Returns the numeric value assigned to the character chr as float. If no such value is defined, default is returned, or, if not given, ValueError is raised: >>> unicodedata . numeric ( 'Â½' ) 0.5 unicodedata. category ( chr ) Â¶ Returns the general category assigned to the character chr as string. General category names consist of two letters. See the General Category Values section of the Unicode Character Database documentation for a list of category codes. For example: >>> unicodedata . category ( 'A' ) # 'L'etter, 'u'ppercase 'Lu' unicodedata. bidirectional ( chr ) Â¶ Returns the bidirectional class assigned to the character chr as string. If no such value is defined, an empty string is returned. See the Bidirectional Class Values section of the Unicode Character Database documentation for a list of bidirectional codes. For example: >>> unicodedata . bidirectional ( ' \\N{ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT SEVEN} ' ) # 'A'rabic, 'N'umber 'AN' unicodedata. combining ( chr ) Â¶ Returns the canonical combining class assigned to the character chr as integer. Returns 0 if no combining class is defined. See the Canonical Combining Class Values section of the Unicode Character Database for more information. unicodedata. east_asian_width ( chr ) Â¶ Returns the east asian width assigned to the character chr as string. For a list of widths and or more information, see the Unicode Standard Annex #11 . unicodedata. mirrored ( chr ) Â¶ Returns the mirrored property assigned to the character chr as integer. Returns 1 if the character has been identified as a âmirroredâ character in bidirectional text, 0 otherwise. For example: >>> unicodedata . mirrored ( '>' ) 1 unicodedata. decomposition ( chr ) Â¶ Returns the character decomposition mapping assigned to the character chr as string. An empty string is returned in case no such mapping is defined. For example: >>> unicodedata . decomposition ( 'Ã' ) '0041 0303' unicodedata. normalize ( form , unistr ) Â¶ Return the normal form form for the Unicode string unistr . Valid values for form are âNFCâ, âNFKCâ, âNFDâ, and âNFKDâ. The Unicode standard defines various normalization forms of a Unicode string, based on the definition of canonical equivalence and compatibility equivalence. In Unicode, several characters can be expressed in various way. For example, the character U+00C7 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA) can also be expressed as the sequence U+0043 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C) U+0327 (COMBINING CEDILLA). For each character, there are two normal forms: normal form C and normal form D. Normal form D (NFD) is also known as canonical decomposition, and translates each character into its decomposed form. Normal form C (NFC) first applies a canonical decomposition, then composes pre-combined characters again. In addition to these two forms, there are two additional normal forms based on compatibility equivalence. In Unicode, certain characters are supported which normally would be unified with other characters. For example, U+2160 (ROMAN NUMERAL ONE) is really the same thing as U+0049 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I). However, it is supported in Unicode for compatibility with existing character sets (for example, gb2312). The normal form KD (NFKD) will apply the compatibility decomposition, that is, replace all compatibility characters with their equivalents. The normal form KC (NFKC) first applies the compatibility decomposition, followed by the canonical composition. Even if two unicode strings are normalized and look the same to a human reader, if one has combining characters and the other doesnât, they may not compare equal. unicodedata. is_normalized ( form , unistr ) Â¶ Return whether the Unicode string unistr is in the normal form form . Valid values for form are âNFCâ, âNFKCâ, âNFDâ, and âNFKDâ. Added in version 3.8. In addition, the module exposes the following constant: unicodedata. unidata_version Â¶ The version of the Unicode database used in this module. unicodedata. ucd_3_2_0 Â¶ This is an object that has the same methods as the entire module, but uses the Unicode database version 3.2 instead, for applications that require this specific version of the Unicode database (such as IDNA).

      "text_content": "stringprep â Internet String Preparation Â¶ Source code: Lib/stringprep.py When identifying things (such as host names) in the internet, it is often necessary to compare such identifications for âequalityâ. Exactly how this comparison is executed may depend on the application domain, e.g. whether it should be case-insensitive or not. It may be also necessary to restrict the possible identifications, to allow only identifications consisting of âprintableâ characters. RFC 3454 defines a procedure for âpreparingâ Unicode strings in internet protocols. Before passing strings onto the wire, they are processed with the preparation procedure, after which they have a certain normalized form. The RFC defines a set of tables, which can be combined into profiles. Each profile must define which tables it uses, and what other optional parts of the stringprep procedure are part of the profile. One example of a stringprep profile is nameprep , which is used for internationalized domain names. The module stringprep only exposes the tables from RFC 3454 . As these tables would be very large to represent as dictionaries or lists, the module uses the Unicode character database internally. The module source code itself was generated using the mkstringprep.py utility. As a result, these tables are exposed as functions, not as data structures. There are two kinds of tables in the RFC: sets and mappings. For a set, stringprep provides the âcharacteristic functionâ, i.e. a function that returns True if the parameter is part of the set. For mappings, it provides the mapping function: given the key, it returns the associated value. Below is a list of all functions available in the module. stringprep. in_table_a1 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableA.1 (Unassigned code points in Unicode 3.2). stringprep. in_table_b1 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableB.1 (Commonly mapped to nothing). stringprep. map_table_b2 ( code ) Â¶ Return the mapped value for code according to tableB.2 (Mapping for case-folding used with NFKC). stringprep. map_table_b3 ( code ) Â¶ Return the mapped value for code according to tableB.3 (Mapping for case-folding used with no normalization). stringprep. in_table_c11 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableC.1.1 (ASCII space characters). stringprep. in_table_c12 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableC.1.2 (Non-ASCII space characters). stringprep. in_table_c11_c12 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableC.1 (Space characters, union of C.1.1 and C.1.2). stringprep. in_table_c21 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableC.2.1 (ASCII control characters). stringprep. in_table_c22 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableC.2.2 (Non-ASCII control characters). stringprep. in_table_c21_c22 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableC.2 (Control characters, union of C.2.1 and C.2.2). stringprep. in_table_c3 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableC.3 (Private use). stringprep. in_table_c4 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableC.4 (Non-character code points). stringprep. in_table_c5 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableC.5 (Surrogate codes). stringprep. in_table_c6 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableC.6 (Inappropriate for plain text). stringprep. in_table_c7 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableC.7 (Inappropriate for canonical representation). stringprep. in_table_c8 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableC.8 (Change display properties or are deprecated). stringprep. in_table_c9 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableC.9 (Tagging characters). stringprep. in_table_d1 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableD.1 (Characters with bidirectional property âRâ or âALâ). stringprep. in_table_d2 ( code ) Â¶ Determine whether code is in tableD.2 (Characters with bidirectional property âLâ).",

      "text_content": "readline â GNU readline interface Â¶ The readline module defines a number of functions to facilitate completion and reading/writing of history files from the Python interpreter. This module can be used directly, or via the rlcompleter module, which supports completion of Python identifiers at the interactive prompt. Settings made using this module affect the behaviour of both the interpreterâs interactive prompt and the prompts offered by the built-in input() function. Readline keybindings may be configured via an initialization file, typically .inputrc in your home directory. See Readline Init File in the GNU Readline manual for information about the format and allowable constructs of that file, and the capabilities of the Readline library in general. Availability : not Android, not iOS, not WASI. This module is not supported on mobile platforms or WebAssembly platforms . This is an optional module . If it is missing from your copy of CPython, look for documentation from your distributor (that is, whoever provided Python to you). If you are the distributor, see Requirements for optional modules . Note The underlying Readline library API may be implemented by the editline ( libedit ) library instead of GNU readline. On macOS the readline module detects which library is being used at run time. The configuration file for editline is different from that of GNU readline. If you programmatically load configuration strings you can use backend to determine which library is being used. If you use editline / libedit readline emulation on macOS, the initialization file located in your home directory is named .editrc . For example, the following content in ~/.editrc will turn ON vi keybindings and TAB completion: python : bind - v python : bind ^ I rl_complete Also note that different libraries may use different history file formats. When switching the underlying library, existing history files may become unusable. readline. backend Â¶ The name of the underlying Readline library being used, either \"readline\" or \"editline\" . Added in version 3.13. Init file Â¶ The following functions relate to the init file and user configuration: readline. parse_and_bind ( string ) Â¶ Execute the init line provided in the string argument. This calls rl_parse_and_bind() in the underlying library. readline. read_init_file ( [ filename ] ) Â¶ Execute a readline initialization file. The default filename is the last filename used. This calls rl_read_init_file() in the underlying library. It raises an auditing event open with the file name if given, and \"<readline_init_file>\" otherwise, regardless of which file the library resolves. Changed in version 3.14: The auditing event was added. Line buffer Â¶ The following functions operate on the line buffer: readline. get_line_buffer ( ) Â¶ Return the current contents of the line buffer ( rl_line_buffer in the underlying library). readline. insert_text ( string ) Â¶ Insert text into the line buffer at the cursor position. This calls rl_insert_text() in the underlying library, but ignores the return value. readline. redisplay ( ) Â¶ Change whatâs displayed on the screen to reflect the current contents of the line buffer. This calls rl_redisplay() in the underlying library. History file Â¶ The following functions operate on a history file: readline. read_history_file ( [ filename ] ) Â¶ Load a readline history file, and append it to the history list. The default filename is ~/.history . This calls read_history() in the underlying library and raises an auditing event open with the file name if given and \"~/.history\" otherwise. Changed in version 3.14: The auditing event was added. readline. write_history_file ( [ filename ] ) Â¶ Save the history list to a readline history file, overwriting any existing file. The default filename is ~/.history . This calls write_history() in the underlying library and raises an auditing event open with the file name if given and \"~/.history\" otherwise. Changed in version 3.14: The auditing event was added. readline. append_history_file ( nelements [ , filename ] ) Â¶ Append the last nelements items of history to a file. The default filename is ~/.history . The file must already exist. This calls append_history() in the underlying library. This function only exists if Python was compiled for a version of the library that supports it. It raises an auditing event open with the file name if given and \"~/.history\" otherwise. Added in version 3.5. Changed in version 3.14: The auditing event was added. readline. get_history_length ( ) Â¶ readline. set_history_length ( length ) Â¶ Set or return the desired number of lines to save in the history file. The write_history_file() function uses this value to truncate the history file, by calling history_truncate_file() in the underlying library. Negative values imply unlimited history file size. History list Â¶ The following functions operate on a global history list: readline. clear_history ( ) Â¶ Clear the current history. This calls clear_history() in the underlying library. The Python function only exists if Python was compiled for a version of the library that supports it. readline. get_current_history_length ( ) Â¶ Return the number of items currently in the history. (This is different from get_history_length() , which returns the maximum number of lines that will be written to a history file.) readline. get_history_item ( index ) Â¶ Return the current contents of history item at index . The item index is one-based. This calls history_get() in the underlying library. readline. remove_history_item ( pos ) Â¶ Remove history item specified by its position from the history. The position is zero-based. This calls remove_history() in the underlying library. readline. replace_history_item ( pos , line ) Â¶ Replace history item specified by its position with line . The position is zero-based. This calls replace_history_entry() in the underlying library. readline. add_history ( line ) Â¶ Append line to the history buffer, as if it was the last line typed. This calls add_history() in the underlying library. readline. set_auto_history ( enabled ) Â¶ Enable or disable automatic calls to add_history() when reading input via readline. The enabled argument should be a Boolean value that when true, enables auto history, and that when false, disables auto history. Added in version 3.6. CPython implementation detail: Auto history is enabled by default, and changes to this do not persist across multiple sessions. Startup hooks Â¶ readline. set_startup_hook ( [ function ] ) Â¶ Set or remove the function invoked by the rl_startup_hook callback of the underlying library. If function is specified, it will be used as the new hook function; if omitted or None , any function already installed is removed. The hook is called with no arguments just before readline prints the first prompt. readline. set_pre_input_hook ( [ function ] ) Â¶ Set or remove the function invoked by the rl_pre_input_hook callback of the underlying library. If function is specified, it will be used as the new hook function; if omitted or None , any function already installed is removed. The hook is called with no arguments after the first prompt has been printed and just before readline starts reading input characters. This function only exists if Python was compiled for a version of the library that supports it. Completion Â¶ The following functions relate to implementing a custom word completion function. This is typically operated by the Tab key, and can suggest and automatically complete a word being typed. By default, Readline is set up to be used by rlcompleter to complete Python identifiers for the interactive interpreter. If the readline module is to be used with a custom completer, a different set of word delimiters should be set. readline. set_completer ( [ function ] ) Â¶ Set or remove the completer function. If function is specified, it will be used as the new completer function; if omitted or None , any completer function already installed is removed. The completer function is called as function(text, state) , for state in 0 , 1 , 2 , â¦, until it returns a non-string value. It should return the next possible completion starting with text . The installed completer function is invoked by the entry_func callback passed to rl_completion_matches() in the underlying library. The text string comes from the first parameter to the rl_attempted_completion_function callback of the underlying library. readline. get_completer ( ) Â¶ Get the completer function, or None if no completer function has been set. readline. get_completion_type ( ) Â¶ Get the type of completion being attempted. This returns the rl_completion_type variable in the underlying library as an integer. readline. get_begidx ( ) Â¶ readline. get_endidx ( ) Â¶ Get the beginning or ending index of the completion scope. These indexes are the start and end arguments passed to the rl_attempted_completion_function callback of the underlying library. The values may be different in the same input editing scenario based on the underlying C readline implementation. Ex: libedit is known to behave differently than libreadline. readline. set_completer_delims ( string ) Â¶ readline. get_completer_delims ( ) Â¶ Set or get the word delimiters for completion. These determine the start of the word to be considered for completion (the completion scope). These functions access the rl_completer_word_break_characters variable in the underlying library. readline. set_completion_display_matches_hook ( [ function ] ) Â¶ Set or remove the completion display function. If function is specified, it will be used as the new completion display function; if omitted or None , any completion display function already installed is removed. This sets or clears the rl_completion_display_matches_hook callback in the underlying library. The completion display function is called as function(substitution, [matches], longest_match_length) once each time matches need to be displayed. Example Â¶ The following example demonstrates how to use the readline moduleâs history reading and writing functions to automatically load and save a history file named .python_history from the userâs home directory. The code below would normally be executed automatically during interactive sessions from the userâs PYTHONSTARTUP file. import atexit import os import readline histfile = os . path . join ( os . path . expanduser ( \"~\" ), \".python_history\" ) try : readline . read_history_file ( histfile ) # default history len is -1 (infinite), which may grow unruly readline . set_history_length ( 1000 ) except FileNotFoundError : pass atexit . register ( readline . write_history_file , histfile ) This code is actually automatically run when Python is run in interactive mode (see Readline configuration ). The following example achieves the same goal but supports concurrent interactive sessions, by only appending the new history. import atexit import os import readline histfile = os . path . join ( os . path . expanduser ( \"~\" ), \".python_history\" ) try : readline . read_history_file ( histfile ) h_len = readline . get_current_history_length () except FileNotFoundError : open ( histfile , 'wb' ) . close () h_len = 0 def save ( prev_h_len , histfile ): new_h_len = readline . get_current_history_length () readline . set_history_length ( 1000 ) readline . append_history_file ( new_h_len - prev_h_len , histfile ) atexit . register ( save , h_len , histfile ) The following example extends the code.InteractiveConsole class to support history save/restore. import atexit import code import os import readline class HistoryConsole ( code . InteractiveConsole ): def __init__ ( self , locals = None , filename = \"<console>\" , histfile = os . path . expanduser ( \"~/.console-history\" )): code . InteractiveConsole . __init__ ( self , locals , filename ) self . init_history ( histfile ) def init_history ( self , histfile ): readline . parse_and_bind ( \"tab: complete\" ) if hasattr ( readline , \"read_history_file\" ): try : readline . read_history_file ( histfile ) except FileNotFoundError : pass atexit . register ( self . save_history , histfile ) def save_history ( self , histfile ): readline . set_history_length ( 1000 ) readline . write_history_file ( histfile ) Note The new REPL introduced in version 3.13 doesnât support readline. However, readline can still be used by setting the PYTHON_BASIC_REPL environment variable.",

      "text_content": "struct â Interpret bytes as packed binary data Â¶ Source code: Lib/struct.py This module converts between Python values and C structs represented as Python bytes objects. Compact format strings describe the intended conversions to/from Python values. The moduleâs functions and objects can be used for two largely distinct applications, data exchange with external sources (files or network connections), or data transfer between the Python application and the C layer. Note When no prefix character is given, native mode is the default. It packs or unpacks data based on the platform and compiler on which the Python interpreter was built. The result of packing a given C struct includes pad bytes which maintain proper alignment for the C types involved; similarly, alignment is taken into account when unpacking. In contrast, when communicating data between external sources, the programmer is responsible for defining byte ordering and padding between elements. See Byte Order, Size, and Alignment for details. Several struct functions (and methods of Struct ) take a buffer argument. This refers to objects that implement the Buffer Protocol and provide either a readable or read-writable buffer. The most common types used for that purpose are bytes and bytearray , but many other types that can be viewed as an array of bytes implement the buffer protocol, so that they can be read/filled without additional copying from a bytes object. Functions and Exceptions Â¶ The module defines the following exception and functions: exception struct. error Â¶ Exception raised on various occasions; argument is a string describing what is wrong. struct. pack ( format , v1 , v2 , ... ) Â¶ Return a bytes object containing the values v1 , v2 , â¦ packed according to the format string format . The arguments must match the values required by the format exactly. struct. pack_into ( format , buffer , offset , v1 , v2 , ... ) Â¶ Pack the values v1 , v2 , â¦ according to the format string format and write the packed bytes into the writable buffer buffer starting at position offset . Note that offset is a required argument. struct. unpack ( format , buffer ) Â¶ Unpack from the buffer buffer (presumably packed by pack(format, ...) ) according to the format string format . The result is a tuple even if it contains exactly one item. The bufferâs size in bytes must match the size required by the format, as reflected by calcsize() . struct. unpack_from ( format , / , buffer , offset = 0 ) Â¶ Unpack from buffer starting at position offset , according to the format string format . The result is a tuple even if it contains exactly one item. The bufferâs size in bytes, starting at position offset , must be at least the size required by the format, as reflected by calcsize() . struct. iter_unpack ( format , buffer ) Â¶ Iteratively unpack from the buffer buffer according to the format string format . This function returns an iterator which will read equally sized chunks from the buffer until all its contents have been consumed. The bufferâs size in bytes must be a multiple of the size required by the format, as reflected by calcsize() . Each iteration yields a tuple as specified by the format string. Added in version 3.4. struct. calcsize ( format ) Â¶ Return the size of the struct (and hence of the bytes object produced by pack(format, ...) ) corresponding to the format string format . Format Strings Â¶ Format strings describe the data layout when packing and unpacking data. They are built up from format characters , which specify the type of data being packed/unpacked. In addition, special characters control the byte order, size and alignment . Each format string consists of an optional prefix character which describes the overall properties of the data and one or more format characters which describe the actual data values and padding. Byte Order, Size, and Alignment Â¶ By default, C types are represented in the machineâs native format and byte order, and properly aligned by skipping pad bytes if necessary (according to the rules used by the C compiler). This behavior is chosen so that the bytes of a packed struct correspond exactly to the memory layout of the corresponding C struct. Whether to use native byte ordering and padding or standard formats depends on the application. Alternatively, the first character of the format string can be used to indicate the byte order, size and alignment of the packed data, according to the following table: Character Byte order Size Alignment @ native native native = native standard none < little-endian standard none > big-endian standard none ! network (= big-endian) standard none If the first character is not one of these, '@' is assumed. Note The number 1023 ( 0x3ff in hexadecimal) has the following byte representations: 03 ff in big-endian ( > ) ff 03 in little-endian ( < ) Python example: >>> import struct >>> struct . pack ( '>h' , 1023 ) b'\\x03\\xff' >>> struct . pack ( '<h' , 1023 ) b'\\xff\\x03' Native byte order is big-endian or little-endian, depending on the host system. For example, Intel x86, AMD64 (x86-64), and Apple M1 are little-endian; IBM z and many legacy architectures are big-endian. Use sys.byteorder to check the endianness of your system. Native size and alignment are determined using the C compilerâs sizeof expression. This is always combined with native byte order. Standard size depends only on the format character; see the table in the Format Characters section. Note the difference between '@' and '=' : both use native byte order, but the size and alignment of the latter is standardized. The form '!' represents the network byte order which is always big-endian as defined in IETF RFC 1700 . There is no way to indicate non-native byte order (force byte-swapping); use the appropriate choice of '<' or '>' . Notes: Padding is only automatically added between successive structure members. No padding is added at the beginning or the end of the encoded struct. No padding is added when using non-native size and alignment, e.g. with â<â, â>â, â=â, and â!â. To align the end of a structure to the alignment requirement of a particular type, end the format with the code for that type with a repeat count of zero. See Examples . Format Characters Â¶ Format characters have the following meaning; the conversion between C and Python values should be obvious given their types. The âStandard sizeâ column refers to the size of the packed value in bytes when using standard size; that is, when the format string starts with one of '<' , '>' , '!' or '=' . When using native size, the size of the packed value is platform-dependent. Format C Type Python type Standard size Notes x pad byte no value (7) c char bytes of length 1 1 b signed char integer 1 (1), (2) B unsigned char integer 1 (2) ? _Bool bool 1 (1) h short integer 2 (2) H unsigned short integer 2 (2) i int integer 4 (2) I unsigned int integer 4 (2) l long integer 4 (2) L unsigned long integer 4 (2) q long long integer 8 (2) Q unsigned long long integer 8 (2) n ssize_t integer (3) N size_t integer (3) e (6) float 2 (4) f float float 4 (4) d double float 8 (4) F float complex complex 8 (10) D double complex complex 16 (10) s char [ ] bytes (9) p char [ ] bytes (8) P void * integer (5) Changed in version 3.3: Added support for the 'n' and 'N' formats. Changed in version 3.6: Added support for the 'e' format. Changed in version 3.14: Added support for the 'F' and 'D' formats. Notes: The '?' conversion code corresponds to the _Bool type defined by C standards since C99. In standard mode, it is represented by one byte. When attempting to pack a non-integer using any of the integer conversion codes, if the non-integer has a __index__() method then that method is called to convert the argument to an integer before packing. Changed in version 3.2: Added use of the __index__() method for non-integers. The 'n' and 'N' conversion codes are only available for the native size (selected as the default or with the '@' byte order character). For the standard size, you can use whichever of the other integer formats fits your application. For the 'f' , 'd' and 'e' conversion codes, the packed representation uses the IEEE 754 binary32, binary64 or binary16 format (for 'f' , 'd' or 'e' respectively), regardless of the floating-point format used by the platform. The 'P' format character is only available for the native byte ordering (selected as the default or with the '@' byte order character). The byte order character '=' chooses to use little- or big-endian ordering based on the host system. The struct module does not interpret this as native ordering, so the 'P' format is not available. The IEEE 754 binary16 âhalf precisionâ type was introduced in the 2008 revision of the IEEE 754 standard . It has a sign bit, a 5-bit exponent and 11-bit precision (with 10 bits explicitly stored), and can represent numbers between approximately 6.1e-05 and 6.5e+04 at full precision. This type is not widely supported by C compilers: on a typical machine, an unsigned short can be used for storage, but not for math operations. See the Wikipedia page on the half-precision floating-point format for more information. When packing, 'x' inserts one NUL byte. The 'p' format character encodes a âPascal stringâ, meaning a short variable-length string stored in a fixed number of bytes , given by the count. The first byte stored is the length of the string, or 255, whichever is smaller. The bytes of the string follow. If the string passed in to pack() is too long (longer than the count minus 1), only the leading count-1 bytes of the string are stored. If the string is shorter than count-1 , it is padded with null bytes so that exactly count bytes in all are used. Note that for unpack() , the 'p' format character consumes count bytes, but that the string returned can never contain more than 255 bytes. For the 's' format character, the count is interpreted as the length of the bytes, not a repeat count like for the other format characters; for example, '10s' means a single 10-byte string mapping to or from a single Python byte string, while '10c' means 10 separate one byte character elements (e.g., cccccccccc ) mapping to or from ten different Python byte objects. (See Examples for a concrete demonstration of the difference.) If a count is not given, it defaults to 1. For packing, the string is truncated or padded with null bytes as appropriate to make it fit. For unpacking, the resulting bytes object always has exactly the specified number of bytes. As a special case, '0s' means a single, empty string (while '0c' means 0 characters). For the 'F' and 'D' format characters, the packed representation uses the IEEE 754 binary32 and binary64 format for components of the complex number, regardless of the floating-point format used by the platform. Note that complex types ( F and D ) are available unconditionally, despite complex types being an optional feature in C. As specified in the C11 standard, each complex type is represented by a two-element C array containing, respectively, the real and imaginary parts. A format character may be preceded by an integral repeat count. For example, the format string '4h' means exactly the same as 'hhhh' . Whitespace characters between formats are ignored; a count and its format must not contain whitespace though. When packing a value x using one of the integer formats ( 'b' , 'B' , 'h' , 'H' , 'i' , 'I' , 'l' , 'L' , 'q' , 'Q' ), if x is outside the valid range for that format then struct.error is raised. Changed in version 3.1: Previously, some of the integer formats wrapped out-of-range values and raised DeprecationWarning instead of struct.error . For the '?' format character, the return value is either True or False . When packing, the truth value of the argument object is used. Either 0 or 1 in the native or standard bool representation will be packed, and any non-zero value will be True when unpacking. Examples Â¶ Note Native byte order examples (designated by the '@' format prefix or lack of any prefix character) may not match what the readerâs machine produces as that depends on the platform and compiler. Pack and unpack integers of three different sizes, using big endian ordering: >>> from struct import * >>> pack ( \">bhl\" , 1 , 2 , 3 ) b'\\x01\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x03' >>> unpack ( '>bhl' , b ' \\x01\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x03 ' ) (1, 2, 3) >>> calcsize ( '>bhl' ) 7 Attempt to pack an integer which is too large for the defined field: >>> pack ( \">h\" , 99999 ) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 1 , in <module> struct.error : 'h' format requires -32768 <= number <= 32767 Demonstrate the difference between 's' and 'c' format characters: >>> pack ( \"@ccc\" , b '1' , b '2' , b '3' ) b'123' >>> pack ( \"@3s\" , b '123' ) b'123' Unpacked fields can be named by assigning them to variables or by wrapping the result in a named tuple: >>> record = b 'raymond \\x32\\x12\\x08\\x01\\x08 ' >>> name , serialnum , school , gradelevel = unpack ( '<10sHHb' , record ) >>> from collections import namedtuple >>> Student = namedtuple ( 'Student' , 'name serialnum school gradelevel' ) >>> Student . _make ( unpack ( '<10sHHb' , record )) Student(name=b'raymond ', serialnum=4658, school=264, gradelevel=8) The ordering of format characters may have an impact on size in native mode since padding is implicit. In standard mode, the user is responsible for inserting any desired padding. Note in the first pack call below that three NUL bytes were added after the packed '#' to align the following integer on a four-byte boundary. In this example, the output was produced on a little endian machine: >>> pack ( '@ci' , b '#' , 0x12131415 ) b'#\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x15\\x14\\x13\\x12' >>> pack ( '@ic' , 0x12131415 , b '#' ) b'\\x15\\x14\\x13\\x12#' >>> calcsize ( '@ci' ) 8 >>> calcsize ( '@ic' ) 5 The following format 'llh0l' results in two pad bytes being added at the end, assuming the platformâs longs are aligned on 4-byte boundaries: >>> pack ( '@llh0l' , 1 , 2 , 3 ) b'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x01\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x02\\x00\\x03\\x00\\x00' See also Module array Packed binary storage of homogeneous data. Module json JSON encoder and decoder. Module pickle Python object serialization. Applications Â¶ Two main applications for the struct module exist, data interchange between Python and C code within an application or another application compiled using the same compiler ( native formats ), and data interchange between applications using agreed upon data layout ( standard formats ). Generally speaking, the format strings constructed for these two domains are distinct. Native Formats Â¶ When constructing format strings which mimic native layouts, the compiler and machine architecture determine byte ordering and padding. In such cases, the @ format character should be used to specify native byte ordering and data sizes. Internal pad bytes are normally inserted automatically. It is possible that a zero-repeat format code will be needed at the end of a format string to round up to the correct byte boundary for proper alignment of consecutive chunks of data. Consider these two simple examples (on a 64-bit, little-endian machine): >>> calcsize ( '@lhl' ) 24 >>> calcsize ( '@llh' ) 18 Data is not padded to an 8-byte boundary at the end of the second format string without the use of extra padding. A zero-repeat format code solves that problem: >>> calcsize ( '@llh0l' ) 24 The 'x' format code can be used to specify the repeat, but for native formats it is better to use a zero-repeat format like '0l' . By default, native byte ordering and alignment is used, but it is better to be explicit and use the '@' prefix character. Standard Formats Â¶ When exchanging data beyond your process such as networking or storage, be precise. Specify the exact byte order, size, and alignment. Do not assume they match the native order of a particular machine. For example, network byte order is big-endian, while many popular CPUs are little-endian. By defining this explicitly, the user need not care about the specifics of the platform their code is running on. The first character should typically be < or > (or ! ). Padding is the responsibility of the programmer. The zero-repeat format character wonât work. Instead, the user must explicitly add 'x' pad bytes where needed. Revisiting the examples from the previous section, we have: >>> calcsize ( '<qh6xq' ) 24 >>> pack ( '<qh6xq' , 1 , 2 , 3 ) == pack ( '@lhl' , 1 , 2 , 3 ) True >>> calcsize ( '@llh' ) 18 >>> pack ( '@llh' , 1 , 2 , 3 ) == pack ( '<qqh' , 1 , 2 , 3 ) True >>> calcsize ( '<qqh6x' ) 24 >>> calcsize ( '@llh0l' ) 24 >>> pack ( '@llh0l' , 1 , 2 , 3 ) == pack ( '<qqh6x' , 1 , 2 , 3 ) True The above results (executed on a 64-bit machine) arenât guaranteed to match when executed on different machines. For example, the examples below were executed on a 32-bit machine: >>> calcsize ( '<qqh6x' ) 24 >>> calcsize ( '@llh0l' ) 12 >>> pack ( '@llh0l' , 1 , 2 , 3 ) == pack ( '<qqh6x' , 1 , 2 , 3 ) False Classes Â¶ The struct module also defines the following type: class struct. Struct ( format ) Â¶ Return a new Struct object which writes and reads binary data according to the format string format . Creating a Struct object once and calling its methods is more efficient than calling module-level functions with the same format since the format string is only compiled once. Note The compiled versions of the most recent format strings passed to the module-level functions are cached, so programs that use only a few format strings neednât worry about reusing a single Struct instance. Compiled Struct objects support the following methods and attributes: pack ( v1 , v2 , ... ) Â¶ Identical to the pack() function, using the compiled format. ( len(result) will equal size .) pack_into ( buffer , offset , v1 , v2 , ... ) Â¶ Identical to the pack_into() function, using the compiled format. unpack ( buffer ) Â¶ Identical to the unpack() function, using the compiled format. The bufferâs size in bytes must equal size . unpack_from ( buffer , offset = 0 ) Â¶ Identical to the unpack_from() function, using the compiled format. The bufferâs size in bytes, starting at position offset , must be at least size . iter_unpack ( buffer ) Â¶ Identical to the iter_unpack() function, using the compiled format. The bufferâs size in bytes must be a multiple of size . Added in version 3.4. format Â¶ The format string used to construct this Struct object. Changed in version 3.7: The format string type is now str instead of bytes . size Â¶ The calculated size of the struct (and hence of the bytes object produced by the pack() method) corresponding to format . Changed in version 3.13: The repr() of structs has changed. It is now: >>> Struct ( 'i' ) Struct('i')",

      "text_content": "codecs â Codec registry and base classes Â¶ Source code: Lib/codecs.py This module defines base classes for standard Python codecs (encoders and decoders) and provides access to the internal Python codec registry, which manages the codec and error handling lookup process. Most standard codecs are text encodings , which encode text to bytes (and decode bytes to text), but there are also codecs provided that encode text to text, and bytes to bytes. Custom codecs may encode and decode between arbitrary types, but some module features are restricted to be used specifically with text encodings or with codecs that encode to bytes . The module defines the following functions for encoding and decoding with any codec: codecs. encode ( obj , encoding = 'utf-8' , errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ Encodes obj using the codec registered for encoding . Errors may be given to set the desired error handling scheme. The default error handler is 'strict' meaning that encoding errors raise ValueError (or a more codec specific subclass, such as UnicodeEncodeError ). Refer to Codec Base Classes for more information on codec error handling. codecs. decode ( obj , encoding = 'utf-8' , errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ Decodes obj using the codec registered for encoding . Errors may be given to set the desired error handling scheme. The default error handler is 'strict' meaning that decoding errors raise ValueError (or a more codec specific subclass, such as UnicodeDecodeError ). Refer to Codec Base Classes for more information on codec error handling. codecs. charmap_build ( string ) Â¶ Return a mapping suitable for encoding with a custom single-byte encoding. Given a str string of up to 256 characters representing a decoding table, returns either a compact internal mapping object EncodingMap or a dictionary mapping character ordinals to byte values. Raises a TypeError on invalid input. The full details for each codec can also be looked up directly: codecs. lookup ( encoding , / ) Â¶ Looks up the codec info in the Python codec registry and returns a CodecInfo object as defined below. Encodings are first looked up in the registryâs cache. If not found, the list of registered search functions is scanned. If no CodecInfo object is found, a LookupError is raised. Otherwise, the CodecInfo object is stored in the cache and returned to the caller. class codecs. CodecInfo ( encode , decode , streamreader = None , streamwriter = None , incrementalencoder = None , incrementaldecoder = None , name = None ) Â¶ Codec details when looking up the codec registry. The constructor arguments are stored in attributes of the same name: name Â¶ The name of the encoding. encode Â¶ decode Â¶ The stateless encoding and decoding functions. These must be functions or methods which have the same interface as the encode() and decode() methods of Codec instances (see Codec Interface ). The functions or methods are expected to work in a stateless mode. incrementalencoder Â¶ incrementaldecoder Â¶ Incremental encoder and decoder classes or factory functions. These have to provide the interface defined by the base classes IncrementalEncoder and IncrementalDecoder , respectively. Incremental codecs can maintain state. streamwriter Â¶ streamreader Â¶ Stream writer and reader classes or factory functions. These have to provide the interface defined by the base classes StreamWriter and StreamReader , respectively. Stream codecs can maintain state. To simplify access to the various codec components, the module provides these additional functions which use lookup() for the codec lookup: codecs. getencoder ( encoding ) Â¶ Look up the codec for the given encoding and return its encoder function. Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found. codecs. getdecoder ( encoding ) Â¶ Look up the codec for the given encoding and return its decoder function. Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found. codecs. getincrementalencoder ( encoding ) Â¶ Look up the codec for the given encoding and return its incremental encoder class or factory function. Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found or the codec doesnât support an incremental encoder. codecs. getincrementaldecoder ( encoding ) Â¶ Look up the codec for the given encoding and return its incremental decoder class or factory function. Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found or the codec doesnât support an incremental decoder. codecs. getreader ( encoding ) Â¶ Look up the codec for the given encoding and return its StreamReader class or factory function. Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found. codecs. getwriter ( encoding ) Â¶ Look up the codec for the given encoding and return its StreamWriter class or factory function. Raises a LookupError in case the encoding cannot be found. Custom codecs are made available by registering a suitable codec search function: codecs. register ( search_function , / ) Â¶ Register a codec search function. Search functions are expected to take one argument, being the encoding name in all lower case letters with hyphens and spaces converted to underscores, and return a CodecInfo object. In case a search function cannot find a given encoding, it should return None . Changed in version 3.9: Hyphens and spaces are converted to underscore. codecs. unregister ( search_function , / ) Â¶ Unregister a codec search function and clear the registryâs cache. If the search function is not registered, do nothing. Added in version 3.10. While the builtin open() and the associated io module are the recommended approach for working with encoded text files, this module provides additional utility functions and classes that allow the use of a wider range of codecs when working with binary files: codecs. open ( filename , mode = 'r' , encoding = None , errors = 'strict' , buffering = -1 ) Â¶ Open an encoded file using the given mode and return an instance of StreamReaderWriter , providing transparent encoding/decoding. The default file mode is 'r' , meaning to open the file in read mode. Note If encoding is not None , then the underlying encoded files are always opened in binary mode. No automatic conversion of '\\n' is done on reading and writing. The mode argument may be any binary mode acceptable to the built-in open() function; the 'b' is automatically added. encoding specifies the encoding which is to be used for the file. Any encoding that encodes to and decodes from bytes is allowed, and the data types supported by the file methods depend on the codec used. errors may be given to define the error handling. It defaults to 'strict' which causes a ValueError to be raised in case an encoding error occurs. buffering has the same meaning as for the built-in open() function. It defaults to -1 which means that the default buffer size will be used. Changed in version 3.11: The 'U' mode has been removed. Deprecated since version 3.14: codecs.open() has been superseded by open() . codecs. EncodedFile ( file , data_encoding , file_encoding = None , errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ Return a StreamRecoder instance, a wrapped version of file which provides transparent transcoding. The original file is closed when the wrapped version is closed. Data written to the wrapped file is decoded according to the given data_encoding and then written to the original file as bytes using file_encoding . Bytes read from the original file are decoded according to file_encoding , and the result is encoded using data_encoding . If file_encoding is not given, it defaults to data_encoding . errors may be given to define the error handling. It defaults to 'strict' , which causes ValueError to be raised in case an encoding error occurs. codecs. iterencode ( iterator , encoding , errors = 'strict' , ** kwargs ) Â¶ Uses an incremental encoder to iteratively encode the input provided by iterator . iterator must yield str objects. This function is a generator . The errors argument (as well as any other keyword argument) is passed through to the incremental encoder. This function requires that the codec accept text str objects to encode. Therefore it does not support bytes-to-bytes encoders such as base64_codec . codecs. iterdecode ( iterator , encoding , errors = 'strict' , ** kwargs ) Â¶ Uses an incremental decoder to iteratively decode the input provided by iterator . iterator must yield bytes objects. This function is a generator . The errors argument (as well as any other keyword argument) is passed through to the incremental decoder. This function requires that the codec accept bytes objects to decode. Therefore it does not support text-to-text encoders such as rot_13 , although rot_13 may be used equivalently with iterencode() . codecs. readbuffer_encode ( buffer , errors = None , / ) Â¶ Return a tuple containing the raw bytes of buffer , a buffer-compatible object or str (encoded to UTF-8 before processing), and their length in bytes. The errors argument is ignored. >>> codecs . readbuffer_encode ( b \"Zito\" ) (b'Zito', 4) The module also provides the following constants which are useful for reading and writing to platform dependent files: codecs. BOM Â¶ codecs. BOM_BE Â¶ codecs. BOM_LE Â¶ codecs. BOM_UTF8 Â¶ codecs. BOM_UTF16 Â¶ codecs. BOM_UTF16_BE Â¶ codecs. BOM_UTF16_LE Â¶ codecs. BOM_UTF32 Â¶ codecs. BOM_UTF32_BE Â¶ codecs. BOM_UTF32_LE Â¶ These constants define various byte sequences, being Unicode byte order marks (BOMs) for several encodings. They are used in UTF-16 and UTF-32 data streams to indicate the byte order used, and in UTF-8 as a Unicode signature. BOM_UTF16 is either BOM_UTF16_BE or BOM_UTF16_LE depending on the platformâs native byte order, BOM is an alias for BOM_UTF16 , BOM_LE for BOM_UTF16_LE and BOM_BE for BOM_UTF16_BE . The others represent the BOM in UTF-8 and UTF-32 encodings. Codec Base Classes Â¶ The codecs module defines a set of base classes which define the interfaces for working with codec objects, and can also be used as the basis for custom codec implementations. Each codec has to define four interfaces to make it usable as codec in Python: stateless encoder, stateless decoder, stream reader and stream writer. The stream reader and writers typically reuse the stateless encoder/decoder to implement the file protocols. Codec authors also need to define how the codec will handle encoding and decoding errors. Error Handlers Â¶ To simplify and standardize error handling, codecs may implement different error handling schemes by accepting the errors string argument: >>> 'German Ã, â¬' . encode ( encoding = 'ascii' , errors = 'backslashreplace' ) b'German \\\\xdf, \\\\u266c' >>> 'German Ã, â¬' . encode ( encoding = 'ascii' , errors = 'xmlcharrefreplace' ) b'German &#223;, &#9836;' The following error handlers can be used with all Python Standard Encodings codecs: Value Meaning 'strict' Raise UnicodeError (or a subclass), this is the default. Implemented in strict_errors() . 'ignore' Ignore the malformed data and continue without further notice. Implemented in ignore_errors() . 'replace' Replace with a replacement marker. On encoding, use ? (ASCII character). On decoding, use ï¿½ (U+FFFD, the official REPLACEMENT CHARACTER). Implemented in replace_errors() . 'backslashreplace' Replace with backslashed escape sequences. On encoding, use hexadecimal form of Unicode code point with formats \\x hh \\u xxxx \\U xxxxxxxx . On decoding, use hexadecimal form of byte value with format \\x hh . Implemented in backslashreplace_errors() . 'surrogateescape' On decoding, replace byte with individual surrogate code ranging from U+DC80 to U+DCFF . This code will then be turned back into the same byte when the 'surrogateescape' error handler is used when encoding the data. (See PEP 383 for more.) The following error handlers are only applicable to encoding (within text encodings ): Value Meaning 'xmlcharrefreplace' Replace with XML/HTML numeric character reference, which is a decimal form of Unicode code point with format &# num ; . Implemented in xmlcharrefreplace_errors() . 'namereplace' Replace with \\N{...} escape sequences, what appears in the braces is the Name property from Unicode Character Database. Implemented in namereplace_errors() . In addition, the following error handler is specific to the given codecs: Value Codecs Meaning 'surrogatepass' utf-8, utf-16, utf-32, utf-16-be, utf-16-le, utf-32-be, utf-32-le Allow encoding and decoding surrogate code point ( U+D800 - U+DFFF ) as normal code point. Otherwise these codecs treat the presence of surrogate code point in str as an error. Added in version 3.1: The 'surrogateescape' and 'surrogatepass' error handlers. Changed in version 3.4: The 'surrogatepass' error handler now works with utf-16* and utf-32* codecs. Added in version 3.5: The 'namereplace' error handler. Changed in version 3.5: The 'backslashreplace' error handler now works with decoding and translating. The set of allowed values can be extended by registering a new named error handler: codecs. register_error ( name , error_handler , / ) Â¶ Register the error handling function error_handler under the name name . The error_handler argument will be called during encoding and decoding in case of an error, when name is specified as the errors parameter. For encoding, error_handler will be called with a UnicodeEncodeError instance, which contains information about the location of the error. The error handler must either raise this or a different exception, or return a tuple with a replacement for the unencodable part of the input and a position where encoding should continue. The replacement may be either str or bytes . If the replacement is bytes, the encoder will simply copy them into the output buffer. If the replacement is a string, the encoder will encode the replacement. Encoding continues on original input at the specified position. Negative position values will be treated as being relative to the end of the input string. If the resulting position is out of bound an IndexError will be raised. Decoding and translating works similarly, except UnicodeDecodeError or UnicodeTranslateError will be passed to the handler and that the replacement from the error handler will be put into the output directly. Previously registered error handlers (including the standard error handlers) can be looked up by name: codecs. lookup_error ( name , / ) Â¶ Return the error handler previously registered under the name name . Raises a LookupError in case the handler cannot be found. The following standard error handlers are also made available as module level functions: codecs. strict_errors ( exception ) Â¶ Implements the 'strict' error handling. Each encoding or decoding error raises a UnicodeError . codecs. ignore_errors ( exception ) Â¶ Implements the 'ignore' error handling. Malformed data is ignored; encoding or decoding is continued without further notice. codecs. replace_errors ( exception ) Â¶ Implements the 'replace' error handling. Substitutes ? (ASCII character) for encoding errors or ï¿½ (U+FFFD, the official REPLACEMENT CHARACTER) for decoding errors. codecs. backslashreplace_errors ( exception ) Â¶ Implements the 'backslashreplace' error handling. Malformed data is replaced by a backslashed escape sequence. On encoding, use the hexadecimal form of Unicode code point with formats \\x hh \\u xxxx \\U xxxxxxxx . On decoding, use the hexadecimal form of byte value with format \\x hh . Changed in version 3.5: Works with decoding and translating. codecs. xmlcharrefreplace_errors ( exception ) Â¶ Implements the 'xmlcharrefreplace' error handling (for encoding within text encoding only). The unencodable character is replaced by an appropriate XML/HTML numeric character reference, which is a decimal form of Unicode code point with format &# num ; . codecs. namereplace_errors ( exception ) Â¶ Implements the 'namereplace' error handling (for encoding within text encoding only). The unencodable character is replaced by a \\N{...} escape sequence. The set of characters that appear in the braces is the Name property from Unicode Character Database. For example, the German lowercase letter 'Ã' will be converted to byte sequence \\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S} . Added in version 3.5. Stateless Encoding and Decoding Â¶ The base Codec class defines these methods which also define the function interfaces of the stateless encoder and decoder: class codecs. Codec Â¶ encode ( input , errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ Encodes the object input and returns a tuple (output object, length consumed). For instance, text encoding converts a string object to a bytes object using a particular character set encoding (e.g., cp1252 or iso-8859-1 ). The errors argument defines the error handling to apply. It defaults to 'strict' handling. The method may not store state in the Codec instance. Use StreamWriter for codecs which have to keep state in order to make encoding efficient. The encoder must be able to handle zero length input and return an empty object of the output object type in this situation. decode ( input , errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ Decodes the object input and returns a tuple (output object, length consumed). For instance, for a text encoding , decoding converts a bytes object encoded using a particular character set encoding to a string object. For text encodings and bytes-to-bytes codecs, input must be a bytes object or one which provides the read-only buffer interface â for example, buffer objects and memory mapped files. The errors argument defines the error handling to apply. It defaults to 'strict' handling. The method may not store state in the Codec instance. Use StreamReader for codecs which have to keep state in order to make decoding efficient. The decoder must be able to handle zero length input and return an empty object of the output object type in this situation. Incremental Encoding and Decoding Â¶ The IncrementalEncoder and IncrementalDecoder classes provide the basic interface for incremental encoding and decoding. Encoding/decoding the input isnât done with one call to the stateless encoder/decoder function, but with multiple calls to the encode() / decode() method of the incremental encoder/decoder. The incremental encoder/decoder keeps track of the encoding/decoding process during method calls. The joined output of calls to the encode() / decode() method is the same as if all the single inputs were joined into one, and this input was encoded/decoded with the stateless encoder/decoder. IncrementalEncoder Objects Â¶ The IncrementalEncoder class is used for encoding an input in multiple steps. It defines the following methods which every incremental encoder must define in order to be compatible with the Python codec registry. class codecs. IncrementalEncoder ( errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ Constructor for an IncrementalEncoder instance. All incremental encoders must provide this constructor interface. They are free to add additional keyword arguments, but only the ones defined here are used by the Python codec registry. The IncrementalEncoder may implement different error handling schemes by providing the errors keyword argument. See Error Handlers for possible values. The errors argument will be assigned to an attribute of the same name. Assigning to this attribute makes it possible to switch between different error handling strategies during the lifetime of the IncrementalEncoder object. encode ( object , final = False ) Â¶ Encodes object (taking the current state of the encoder into account) and returns the resulting encoded object. If this is the last call to encode() final must be true (the default is false). reset ( ) Â¶ Reset the encoder to the initial state. The output is discarded: call .encode(object, final=True) , passing an empty byte or text string if necessary, to reset the encoder and to get the output. getstate ( ) Â¶ Return the current state of the encoder which must be an integer. The implementation should make sure that 0 is the most common state. (States that are more complicated than integers can be converted into an integer by marshaling/pickling the state and encoding the bytes of the resulting string into an integer.) setstate ( state ) Â¶ Set the state of the encoder to state . state must be an encoder state returned by getstate() . IncrementalDecoder Objects Â¶ The IncrementalDecoder class is used for decoding an input in multiple steps. It defines the following methods which every incremental decoder must define in order to be compatible with the Python codec registry. class codecs. IncrementalDecoder ( errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ Constructor for an IncrementalDecoder instance. All incremental decoders must provide this constructor interface. They are free to add additional keyword arguments, but only the ones defined here are used by the Python codec registry. The IncrementalDecoder may implement different error handling schemes by providing the errors keyword argument. See Error Handlers for possible values. The errors argument will be assigned to an attribute of the same name. Assigning to this attribute makes it possible to switch between different error handling strategies during the lifetime of the IncrementalDecoder object. decode ( object , final = False ) Â¶ Decodes object (taking the current state of the decoder into account) and returns the resulting decoded object. If this is the last call to decode() final must be true (the default is false). If final is true the decoder must decode the input completely and must flush all buffers. If this isnât possible (e.g. because of incomplete byte sequences at the end of the input) it must initiate error handling just like in the stateless case (which might raise an exception). reset ( ) Â¶ Reset the decoder to the initial state. getstate ( ) Â¶ Return the current state of the decoder. This must be a tuple with two items, the first must be the buffer containing the still undecoded input. The second must be an integer and can be additional state info. (The implementation should make sure that 0 is the most common additional state info.) If this additional state info is 0 it must be possible to set the decoder to the state which has no input buffered and 0 as the additional state info, so that feeding the previously buffered input to the decoder returns it to the previous state without producing any output. (Additional state info that is more complicated than integers can be converted into an integer by marshaling/pickling the info and encoding the bytes of the resulting string into an integer.) setstate ( state ) Â¶ Set the state of the decoder to state . state must be a decoder state returned by getstate() . Stream Encoding and Decoding Â¶ The StreamWriter and StreamReader classes provide generic working interfaces which can be used to implement new encoding submodules very easily. See encodings.utf_8 for an example of how this is done. StreamWriter Objects Â¶ The StreamWriter class is a subclass of Codec and defines the following methods which every stream writer must define in order to be compatible with the Python codec registry. class codecs. StreamWriter ( stream , errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ Constructor for a StreamWriter instance. All stream writers must provide this constructor interface. They are free to add additional keyword arguments, but only the ones defined here are used by the Python codec registry. The stream argument must be a file-like object open for writing text or binary data, as appropriate for the specific codec. The StreamWriter may implement different error handling schemes by providing the errors keyword argument. See Error Handlers for the standard error handlers the underlying stream codec may support. The errors argument will be assigned to an attribute of the same name. Assigning to this attribute makes it possible to switch between different error handling strategies during the lifetime of the StreamWriter object. write ( object ) Â¶ Writes the objectâs contents encoded to the stream. writelines ( list ) Â¶ Writes the concatenated iterable of strings to the stream (possibly by reusing the write() method). Infinite or very large iterables are not supported. The standard bytes-to-bytes codecs do not support this method. reset ( ) Â¶ Resets the codec buffers used for keeping internal state. Calling this method should ensure that the data on the output is put into a clean state that allows appending of new fresh data without having to rescan the whole stream to recover state. In addition to the above methods, the StreamWriter must also inherit all other methods and attributes from the underlying stream. StreamReader Objects Â¶ The StreamReader class is a subclass of Codec and defines the following methods which every stream reader must define in order to be compatible with the Python codec registry. class codecs. StreamReader ( stream , errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ Constructor for a StreamReader instance. All stream readers must provide this constructor interface. They are free to add additional keyword arguments, but only the ones defined here are used by the Python codec registry. The stream argument must be a file-like object open for reading text or binary data, as appropriate for the specific codec. The StreamReader may implement different error handling schemes by providing the errors keyword argument. See Error Handlers for the standard error handlers the underlying stream codec may support. The errors argument will be assigned to an attribute of the same name. Assigning to this attribute makes it possible to switch between different error handling strategies during the lifetime of the StreamReader object. The set of allowed values for the errors argument can be extended with register_error() . read ( size = -1 , chars = -1 , firstline = False ) Â¶ Decodes data from the stream and returns the resulting object. The chars argument indicates the number of decoded code points or bytes to return. The read() method will never return more data than requested, but it might return less, if there is not enough available. The size argument indicates the approximate maximum number of encoded bytes or code points to read for decoding. The decoder can modify this setting as appropriate. The default value -1 indicates to read and decode as much as possible. This parameter is intended to prevent having to decode huge files in one step. The firstline flag indicates that it would be sufficient to only return the first line, if there are decoding errors on later lines. The method should use a greedy read strategy meaning that it should read as much data as is allowed within the definition of the encoding and the given size, e.g. if optional encoding endings or state markers are available on the stream, these should be read too. readline ( size = None , keepends = True ) Â¶ Read one line from the input stream and return the decoded data. size , if given, is passed as size argument to the streamâs read() method. If keepends is false line-endings will be stripped from the lines returned. readlines ( sizehint = None , keepends = True ) Â¶ Read all lines available on the input stream and return them as a list of lines. Line-endings are implemented using the codecâs decode() method and are included in the list entries if keepends is true. sizehint , if given, is passed as the size argument to the streamâs read() method. reset ( ) Â¶ Resets the codec buffers used for keeping internal state. Note that no stream repositioning should take place. This method is primarily intended to be able to recover from decoding errors. In addition to the above methods, the StreamReader must also inherit all other methods and attributes from the underlying stream. StreamReaderWriter Objects Â¶ The StreamReaderWriter is a convenience class that allows wrapping streams which work in both read and write modes. The design is such that one can use the factory functions returned by the lookup() function to construct the instance. class codecs. StreamReaderWriter ( stream , Reader , Writer , errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ Creates a StreamReaderWriter instance. stream must be a file-like object. Reader and Writer must be factory functions or classes providing the StreamReader and StreamWriter interface resp. Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the stream readers and writers. StreamReaderWriter instances define the combined interfaces of StreamReader and StreamWriter classes. They inherit all other methods and attributes from the underlying stream. StreamRecoder Objects Â¶ The StreamRecoder translates data from one encoding to another, which is sometimes useful when dealing with different encoding environments. The design is such that one can use the factory functions returned by the lookup() function to construct the instance. class codecs. StreamRecoder ( stream , encode , decode , Reader , Writer , errors = 'strict' ) Â¶ Creates a StreamRecoder instance which implements a two-way conversion: encode and decode work on the frontend â the data visible to code calling read() and write() , while Reader and Writer work on the backend â the data in stream . You can use these objects to do transparent transcodings, e.g., from Latin-1 to UTF-8 and back. The stream argument must be a file-like object. The encode and decode arguments must adhere to the Codec interface. Reader and Writer must be factory functions or classes providing objects of the StreamReader and StreamWriter interface respectively. Error handling is done in the same way as defined for the stream readers and writers. StreamRecoder instances define the combined interfaces of StreamReader and StreamWriter classes. They inherit all other methods and attributes from the underlying stream. Encodings and Unicode Â¶ Strings are stored internally as sequences of code points in range U+0000 â U+10FFFF . (See PEP 393 for more details about the implementation.) Once a string object is used outside of CPU and memory, endianness and how these arrays are stored as bytes become an issue. As with other codecs, serialising a string into a sequence of bytes is known as encoding , and recreating the string from the sequence of bytes is known as decoding . There are a variety of different text serialisation codecs, which are collectivity referred to as text encodings . The simplest text encoding (called 'latin-1' or 'iso-8859-1' ) maps the code points 0â255 to the bytes 0x0 â 0xff , which means that a string object that contains code points above U+00FF canât be encoded with this codec. Doing so will raise a UnicodeEncodeError that looks like the following (although the details of the error message may differ): UnicodeEncodeError: 'latin-1' codec can't encode character '\\u1234' in position 3: ordinal not in range(256) . Thereâs another group of encodings (the so called charmap encodings) that choose a different subset of all Unicode code points and how these code points are mapped to the bytes 0x0 â 0xff . To see how this is done simply open e.g. encodings/cp1252.py (which is an encoding that is used primarily on Windows). Thereâs a string constant with 256 characters that shows you which character is mapped to which byte value. All of these encodings can only encode 256 of the 1114112 code points defined in Unicode. A simple and straightforward way that can store each Unicode code point, is to store each code point as four consecutive bytes. There are two possibilities: store the bytes in big endian or in little endian order. These two encodings are called UTF-32-BE and UTF-32-LE respectively. Their disadvantage is that if, for example, you use UTF-32-BE on a little endian machine you will always have to swap bytes on encoding and decoding. Pythonâs UTF-16 and UTF-32 codecs avoid this problem by using the platformâs native byte order when no BOM is present. Python follows prevailing platform practice, so native-endian data round-trips without redundant byte swapping, even though the Unicode Standard defaults to big-endian when the byte order is unspecified. When these bytes are read by a CPU with a different endianness, the bytes have to be swapped. To be able to detect the endianness of a UTF-16 or UTF-32 byte sequence, a BOM (âByte Order Markâ) is used. This is the Unicode character U+FEFF . This character can be prepended to every UTF-16 or UTF-32 byte sequence. The byte swapped version of this character ( 0xFFFE ) is an illegal character that may not appear in a Unicode text. When the first character of a UTF-16 or UTF-32 byte sequence is U+FFFE , the bytes have to be swapped on decoding. Unfortunately the character U+FEFF had a second purpose as a ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE : a character that has no width and doesnât allow a word to be split. It can e.g. be used to give hints to a ligature algorithm. With Unicode 4.0 using U+FEFF as a ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE has been deprecated (with U+2060 ( WORD JOINER ) assuming this role). Nevertheless Unicode software still must be able to handle U+FEFF in both roles: as a BOM itâs a device to determine the storage layout of the encoded bytes, and vanishes once the byte sequence has been decoded into a string; as a ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE itâs a normal character that will be decoded like any other. Thereâs another encoding that is able to encode the full range of Unicode characters: UTF-8. UTF-8 is an 8-bit encoding, which means there are no issues with byte order in UTF-8. Each byte in a UTF-8 byte sequence consists of two parts: marker bits (the most significant bits) and payload bits. The marker bits are a sequence of zero to four 1 bits followed by a 0 bit. Unicode characters are encoded like this (with x being payload bits, which when concatenated give the Unicode character): Range Encoding U-00000000 â¦ U-0000007F 0xxxxxxx U-00000080 â¦ U-000007FF 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx U-00000800 â¦ U-0000FFFF 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx U-00010000 â¦ U-0010FFFF 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx The least significant bit of the Unicode character is the rightmost x bit. As UTF-8 is an 8-bit encoding no BOM is required and any U+FEFF character in the decoded string (even if itâs the first character) is treated as a ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE . Without external information itâs impossible to reliably determine which encoding was used for encoding a string. Each charmap encoding can decode any random byte sequence. However thatâs not possible with UTF-8, as UTF-8 byte sequences have a structure that doesnât allow arbitrary byte sequences. To increase the reliability with which a UTF-8 encoding can be detected, Microsoft invented a variant of UTF-8 (that Python calls \"utf-8-sig\" ) for its Notepad program: Before any of the Unicode characters is written to the file, a UTF-8 encoded BOM (which looks like this as a byte sequence: 0xef , 0xbb , 0xbf ) is written. As itâs rather improbable that any charmap encoded file starts with these byte values (which would e.g. map to LATIN SMALL LETTER I WITH DIAERESIS RIGHT-POINTING DOUBLE ANGLE QUOTATION MARK INVERTED QUESTION MARK in iso-8859-1), this increases the probability that a utf-8-sig encoding can be correctly guessed from the byte sequence. So here the BOM is not used to be able to determine the byte order used for generating the byte sequence, but as a signature that helps in guessing the encoding. On encoding the utf-8-sig codec will write 0xef , 0xbb , 0xbf as the first three bytes to the file. On decoding utf-8-sig will skip those three bytes if they appear as the first three bytes in the file. In UTF-8, the use of the BOM is discouraged and should generally be avoided. Standard Encodings Â¶ Python comes with a number of codecs built-in, either implemented as C functions or with dictionaries as mapping tables. The following table lists the codecs by name, together with a few common aliases, and the languages for which the encoding is likely used. Neither the list of aliases nor the list of languages is meant to be exhaustive. Notice that spelling alternatives that only differ in case or use a hyphen instead of an underscore are also valid aliases because they are equivalent when normalized by normalize_encoding() . For example, 'utf-8' is a valid alias for the 'utf_8' codec. Note The below table lists the most common aliases, for a complete list refer to the source aliases.py file. On Windows, cpXXX codecs are available for all code pages. But only codecs listed in the following table are guarantead to exist on other platforms. CPython implementation detail: Some common encodings can bypass the codecs lookup machinery to improve performance. These optimization opportunities are only recognized by CPython for a limited set of (case insensitive) aliases: utf-8, utf8, latin-1, latin1, iso-8859-1, iso8859-1, mbcs (Windows only), ascii, us-ascii, utf-16, utf16, utf-32, utf32, and the same using underscores instead of dashes. Using alternative aliases for these encodings may result in slower execution. Changed in version 3.6: Optimization opportunity recognized for us-ascii. Many of the character sets support the same languages. They vary in individual characters (e.g. whether the EURO SIGN is supported or not), and in the assignment of characters to code positions. For the European languages in particular, the following variants typically exist: an ISO 8859 codeset a Microsoft Windows code page, which is typically derived from an 8859 codeset, but replaces control characters with additional graphic characters an IBM EBCDIC code page an IBM PC code page, which is ASCII compatible Codec Aliases Languages ascii 646, us-ascii English big5 big5-tw, csbig5 Traditional Chinese big5hkscs big5-hkscs, hkscs Traditional Chinese cp037 IBM037, IBM039 English cp273 273, IBM273, csIBM273 German Added in version 3.4. cp424 EBCDIC-CP-HE, IBM424 Hebrew cp437 437, IBM437 English cp500 EBCDIC-CP-BE, EBCDIC-CP-CH, IBM500 Western Europe cp720 Arabic cp737 Greek cp775 IBM775 Baltic languages cp850 850, IBM850 Western Europe cp852 852, IBM852 Central and Eastern Europe cp855 855, IBM855 Belarusian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian cp856 Hebrew cp857 857, IBM857 Turkish cp858 858, IBM858 Western Europe cp860 860, IBM860 Portuguese cp861 861, CP-IS, IBM861 Icelandic cp862 862, IBM862 Hebrew cp863 863, IBM863 Canadian cp864 IBM864 Arabic cp865 865, IBM865 Danish, Norwegian cp866 866, IBM866 Russian cp869 869, CP-GR, IBM869 Greek cp874 Thai cp875 Greek cp932 932, ms932, mskanji, ms-kanji, windows-31j Japanese cp949 949, ms949, uhc Korean cp950 950, ms950 Traditional Chinese cp1006 Urdu cp1026 ibm1026 Turkish cp1125 1125, ibm1125, cp866u, ruscii Ukrainian Added in version 3.4. cp1140 ibm1140 Western Europe cp1250 windows-1250 Central and Eastern Europe cp1251 windows-1251 Belarusian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian cp1252 windows-1252 Western Europe cp1253 windows-1253 Greek cp1254 windows-1254 Turkish cp1255 windows-1255 Hebrew cp1256 windows-1256 Arabic cp1257 windows-1257 Baltic languages cp1258 windows-1258 Vietnamese euc_jp eucjp, ujis, u-jis Japanese euc_jis_2004 jisx0213, eucjis2004 Japanese euc_jisx0213 eucjisx0213 Japanese euc_kr euckr, korean, ksc5601, ks_c-5601, ks_c-5601-1987, ksx1001, ks_x-1001 Korean gb2312 chinese, csiso58gb231280, euc-cn, euccn, eucgb2312-cn, gb2312-1980, gb2312-80, iso-ir-58 Simplified Chinese gbk 936, cp936, ms936 Unified Chinese gb18030 gb18030-2000 Unified Chinese hz hzgb, hz-gb, hz-gb-2312 Simplified Chinese iso2022_jp csiso2022jp, iso2022jp, iso-2022-jp Japanese iso2022_jp_1 iso2022jp-1, iso-2022-jp-1 Japanese iso2022_jp_2 iso2022jp-2, iso-2022-jp-2 Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Western Europe, Greek iso2022_jp_2004 iso2022jp-2004, iso-2022-jp-2004 Japanese iso2022_jp_3 iso2022jp-3, iso-2022-jp-3 Japanese iso2022_jp_ext iso2022jp-ext, iso-2022-jp-ext Japanese iso2022_kr csiso2022kr, iso2022kr, iso-2022-kr Korean latin_1 iso-8859-1, iso8859-1, 8859, cp819, latin, latin1, L1 Western Europe iso8859_2 iso-8859-2, latin2, L2 Central and Eastern Europe iso8859_3 iso-8859-3, latin3, L3 Esperanto, Maltese iso8859_4 iso-8859-4, latin4, L4 Northern Europe iso8859_5 iso-8859-5, cyrillic Belarusian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian iso8859_6 iso-8859-6, arabic Arabic iso8859_7 iso-8859-7, greek, greek8 Greek iso8859_8 iso-8859-8, hebrew Hebrew iso8859_9 iso-8859-9, latin5, L5 Turkish iso8859_10 iso-8859-10, latin6, L6 Nordic languages iso8859_11 iso-8859-11, thai Thai languages iso8859_13 iso-8859-13, latin7, L7 Baltic languages iso8859_14 iso-8859-14, latin8, L8 Celtic languages iso8859_15 iso-8859-15, latin9, L9 Western Europe iso8859_16 iso-8859-16, latin10, L10 South-Eastern Europe johab cp1361, ms1361 Korean koi8_r Russian koi8_t Tajik Added in version 3.5. koi8_u Ukrainian kz1048 kz_1048, strk1048_2002, rk1048 Kazakh Added in version 3.5. mac_cyrillic maccyrillic Belarusian, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian mac_greek macgreek Greek mac_iceland maciceland Icelandic mac_latin2 maclatin2, maccentraleurope, mac_centeuro Central and Eastern Europe mac_roman macroman, macintosh Western Europe mac_turkish macturkish Turkish ptcp154 csptcp154, pt154, cp154, cyrillic-asian Kazakh shift_jis csshiftjis, shiftjis, sjis, s_jis Japanese shift_jis_2004 shiftjis2004, sjis_2004, sjis2004 Japanese shift_jisx0213 shiftjisx0213, sjisx0213, s_jisx0213 Japanese utf_32 U32, utf32 all languages utf_32_be UTF-32BE all languages utf_32_le UTF-32LE all languages utf_16 U16, utf16 all languages utf_16_be UTF-16BE all languages utf_16_le UTF-16LE all languages utf_7 U7, unicode-1-1-utf-7 all languages utf_8 U8, UTF, utf8, cp65001 all languages utf_8_sig all languages Changed in version 3.4: The utf-16* and utf-32* encoders no longer allow surrogate code points ( U+D800 â U+DFFF ) to be encoded. The utf-32* decoders no longer decode byte sequences that correspond to surrogate code points. Changed in version 3.8: cp65001 is now an alias to utf_8 . Changed in version 3.14: On Windows, cpXXX codecs are now available for all code pages. Python Specific Encodings Â¶ A number of predefined codecs are specific to Python, so their codec names have no meaning outside Python. These are listed in the tables below based on the expected input and output types (note that while text encodings are the most common use case for codecs, the underlying codec infrastructure supports arbitrary data transforms rather than just text encodings). For asymmetric codecs, the stated meaning describes the encoding direction. Text Encodings Â¶ The following codecs provide str to bytes encoding and bytes-like object to str decoding, similar to the Unicode text encodings. Codec Aliases Meaning idna Implement RFC 3490 , see also encodings.idna . Only errors='strict' is supported. mbcs ansi, dbcs Windows only: Encode the operand according to the ANSI codepage (CP_ACP). oem Windows only: Encode the operand according to the OEM codepage (CP_OEMCP). Added in version 3.6. palmos Encoding of PalmOS 3.5. punycode Implement RFC 3492 . Stateful codecs are not supported. raw_unicode_escape Latin-1 encoding with \\u XXXX and \\U XXXXXXXX for other code points. Existing backslashes are not escaped in any way. It is used in the Python pickle protocol. undefined This Codec should only be used for testing purposes. Raise an exception for all conversions, even empty strings. The error handler is ignored. unicode_escape Encoding suitable as the contents of a Unicode literal in ASCII-encoded Python source code, except that quotes are not escaped. Decode from Latin-1 source code. Beware that Python source code actually uses UTF-8 by default. Changed in version 3.8: âunicode_internalâ codec is removed. Binary Transforms Â¶ The following codecs provide binary transforms: bytes-like object to bytes mappings. They are not supported by bytes.decode() (which only produces str output). Codec Aliases Meaning Encoder / decoder base64_codec [ 1 ] base64, base_64 Convert the operand to multiline MIME base64 (the result always includes a trailing '\\n' ). Changed in version 3.4: accepts any bytes-like object as input for encoding and decoding base64.encodebytes() / base64.decodebytes() bz2_codec bz2 Compress the operand using bz2. bz2.compress() / bz2.decompress() hex_codec hex Convert the operand to hexadecimal representation, with two digits per byte. binascii.b2a_hex() / binascii.a2b_hex() quopri_codec quopri, quotedprintable, quoted_printable Convert the operand to MIME quoted printable. quopri.encode() with quotetabs=True / quopri.decode() uu_codec uu Convert the operand using uuencode. zlib_codec zip, zlib Compress the operand using gzip. zlib.compress() / zlib.decompress() Added in version 3.2: Restoration of the binary transforms. Changed in version 3.4: Restoration of the aliases for the binary transforms. Standalone Codec Functions Â¶ The following functions provide encoding and decoding functionality similar to codecs, but are not available as named codecs through codecs.encode() or codecs.decode() . They are used internally (for example, by pickle ) and behave similarly to the string_escape codec that was removed in Python 3. codecs. escape_encode ( input , errors = None ) Â¶ Encode input using escape sequences. Similar to how repr() on bytes produces escaped byte values. input must be a bytes object. Returns a tuple (output, length) where output is a bytes object and length is the number of bytes consumed. codecs. escape_decode ( input , errors = None ) Â¶ Decode input from escape sequences back to the original bytes. input must be a bytes-like object . Returns a tuple (output, length) where output is a bytes object and length is the number of bytes consumed. Text Transforms Â¶ The following codec provides a text transform: a str to str mapping. It is not supported by str.encode() (which only produces bytes output). Codec Aliases Meaning rot_13 rot13 Return the Caesar-cypher encryption of the operand. Added in version 3.2: Restoration of the rot_13 text transform. Changed in version 3.4: Restoration of the rot13 alias. encodings â Encodings package Â¶ This module implements the following functions: encodings. normalize_encoding ( encoding ) Â¶ Normalize encoding name encoding . Normalization works as follows: all non-alphanumeric characters except the dot used for Python package names are collapsed and replaced with a single underscore, leading and trailing underscores are removed. For example, ' -;#' becomes '_' . Note that encoding should be ASCII only. Note The following functions should not be used directly, except for testing purposes; codecs.lookup() should be used instead. encodings. search_function ( encoding ) Â¶ Search for the codec module corresponding to the given encoding name encoding . This function first normalizes the encoding using normalize_encoding() , then looks for a corresponding alias. It attempts to import a codec module from the encodings package using either the alias or the normalized name. If the module is found and defines a valid getregentry() function that returns a codecs.CodecInfo object, the codec is cached and returned. If the codec module defines a getaliases() function any returned aliases are registered for future use. encodings. win32_code_page_search_function ( encoding ) Â¶ Search for a Windows code page encoding encoding of the form cpXXXX . If the code page is valid and supported, return a codecs.CodecInfo object for it. Availability : Windows. Added in version 3.14. This module implements the following exception: exception encodings. CodecRegistryError Â¶ Raised when a codec is invalid or incompatible. encodings.idna â Internationalized Domain Names in Applications Â¶ This module implements RFC 3490 (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications) and RFC 3492 (Nameprep: A Stringprep Profile for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)). It builds upon the punycode encoding and stringprep . If you need the IDNA 2008 standard from RFC 5891 and RFC 5895 , use the third-party idna module. These RFCs together define a protocol to support non-ASCII characters in domain names. A domain name containing non-ASCII characters (such as www.AlliancefranÃ§aise.nu ) is converted into an ASCII-compatible encoding (ACE, such as www.xn--alliancefranaise-npb.nu ). The ACE form of the domain name is then used in all places where arbitrary characters are not allowed by the protocol, such as DNS queries, HTTP Host fields, and so on. This conversion is carried out in the application; if possible invisible to the user: The application should transparently convert Unicode domain labels to IDNA on the wire, and convert back ACE labels to Unicode before presenting them to the user. Python supports this conversion in several ways: the idna codec performs conversion between Unicode and ACE, separating an input string into labels based on the separator characters defined in section 3.1 of RFC 3490 and converting each label to ACE as required, and conversely separating an input byte string into labels based on the . separator and converting any ACE labels found into unicode. Furthermore, the socket module transparently converts Unicode host names to ACE, so that applications need not be concerned about converting host names themselves when they pass them to the socket module. On top of that, modules that have host names as function parameters, such as http.client and ftplib , accept Unicode host names ( http.client then also transparently sends an IDNA hostname in the Host field if it sends that field at all). When receiving host names from the wire (such as in reverse name lookup), no automatic conversion to Unicode is performed: applications wishing to present such host names to the user should decode them to Unicode. The module encodings.idna also implements the nameprep procedure, which performs certain normalizations on host names, to achieve case-insensitivity of international domain names, and to unify similar characters. The nameprep functions can be used directly if desired. encodings.idna. nameprep ( label ) Â¶ Return the nameprepped version of label . The implementation currently assumes query strings, so AllowUnassigned is true. encodings.idna. ToASCII ( label ) Â¶ Convert a label to ASCII, as specified in RFC 3490 . UseSTD3ASCIIRules is assumed to be false. encodings.idna. ToUnicode ( label ) Â¶ Convert a label to Unicode, as specified in RFC 3490 . encodings.mbcs â Windows ANSI codepage Â¶ This module implements the ANSI codepage (CP_ACP). Availability : Windows. Changed in version 3.2: Before 3.2, the errors argument was ignored; 'replace' was always used to encode, and 'ignore' to decode. Changed in version 3.3: Support any error handler. encodings.utf_8_sig â UTF-8 codec with BOM signature Â¶ This module implements a variant of the UTF-8 codec. On encoding, a UTF-8 encoded BOM will be prepended to the UTF-8 encoded bytes. For the stateful encoder this is only done once (on the first write to the byte stream). On decoding, an optional UTF-8 encoded BOM at the start of the data will be skipped.",
