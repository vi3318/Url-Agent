Or read the 5-minute tutorial online. Docusaurus: Documentation Made Easy ​ In this presentation at Algolia Community Event , Meta Open Source team shared a brief walk-through of Docusaurus. They covered how to get started with the project, enable plugins, and set up functionalities like documentation and blogging. Migrating from v1 ​ Docusaurus v2+ has been a total rewrite from Docusaurus v1, taking advantage of a completely modernized toolchain. After v2's official release , we highly encourage you to use Docusaurus v2+ over Docusaurus v1 , as Docusaurus v1 has been deprecated. A lot of users are already using Docusaurus v2+ ( trends ). Use Docusaurus v2+ if: ✅ You want a modern Jamstack documentation site ✅ You want a single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing ✅ You want the full power of React and MDX ✅ You do not need support for IE11 Use Docusaurus v1 if: ❌ You don't want a single-page application (SPA) ❌ You need support for IE11 (...do you? IE has already reached end-of-life and is no longer officially supported) For existing v1 users that are seeking to upgrade to v2+, you can follow our migration guides . Features ​ Docusaurus is built with high attention to the developer and contributor experience. ⚛️ Built with 💚 and React : Extend and customize with React Gain full control of your site's browsing experience by providing your own React components 🔌 Pluggable : Bootstrap your site with a basic template, then use advanced features and plugins Open source your plugins to share with the community ✂️ Developer experience : Start writing your docs right now Universal configuration entry point to make it more maintainable by contributors Hot reloading with lightning-fast incremental build on changes Route-based code and data splitting Publish to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and other deployment services with ease Our shared goal—to help your users quickly find what they need and understand your products better. We share our best practices to help you build your docs site right and well. 🎯 SEO friendly : HTML files are statically generated for every possible path. Page-specific SEO to help your users land on your official docs directly relating their problems at hand. 📝 Powered by MDX : Write interactive components via JSX and React embedded in Markdown. Share your code in live editors to get your users to love your products on the spot. 🔍 Search : Your full site is searchable. 💾 Document Versioning : Helps you keep documentation in sync with project releases. 🌍 Internationalization (i18n) : Translate your site in multiple locales. Docusaurus v2+ is born to be compassionately accessible to all your users, and lightning-fast. ⚡️ Lightning-fast . Docusaurus v2+ follows the PRPL Pattern that makes sure your content loads blazing fast. 🦖 Accessible . Attention to accessibility, making your site equally accessible to all users. Design principles ​ Little to learn . Docusaurus should be easy to learn and use as the API is quite small. Most things will still be achievable by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write. Not having abstractions is better than having the wrong abstractions, and we don't want users to have to hack around the wrong abstractions. Mandatory talk— Minimal API Surface Area . Intuitive . Users will not feel overwhelmed when looking at the project directory of a Docusaurus project or adding new features. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using approaches they are familiar with. Layered architecture . The separations of concerns between each layer of our stack (content/theming/styling) should be clear—well-abstracted and modular. Sensible defaults . Common and popular performance optimizations and configurations will be done for users but they are given the option to override them. No vendor lock-in . Users are not required to use the default plugins or CSS, although they are highly encouraged to. Certain core infrastructures like React Loadable and React Router cannot be swapped because we do default performance optimization on them, but not higher-level ones. Choice of Markdown engines, CSS frameworks, CSS methodology, and other architectures will be entirely up to users. We believe that, as developers, knowing how a library works helps us become better at using it. Hence we're dedicating effort to explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the tool and be even more proficient in using it. Comparison with other tools ​ Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features. We've also studied other main static site generators and would like to share our insights on the comparison, hopefully helping you navigate through the prismatic choices out there. Gatsby ​ Gatsby is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins, and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content. GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don't necessarily need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static websites, you won't need the flexibility that GraphQL provides. Many aspects of Docusaurus v2+ were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it's a great alternative. Docz is a Gatsby theme to build documentation websites. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. Next.js ​ Next.js is another very popular hybrid React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box. Nextra is an opinionated static site generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. VitePress ​ VitePress has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric websites and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VitePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VitePress would be a decent choice. MkDocs ​ MkDocs is a popular Python static site generator with value propositions similar to Docusaurus. It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and don't plan to leverage React. Material for MkDocs is a beautiful theme. Docsify ​ Docsify makes it easy to create a documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO friendly. GitBook ​ GitBook has a very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects' documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus here . Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone. Jekyll ​ Jekyll is one of the most mature static site generators around and has been a great tool to use — in fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook's Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a similar developer experience as building a static site with Jekyll. In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using <script /> tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc sites' performance, asset building pipeline and optimizations, and ease to set up. Rspress ​ Rspress is a fast static site generator based on Rspack, a Rust-based bundler. It supports content writing with MDX (Markdown with React components), integrated text search, multilingual support (i18n), and extensibility through plugins. Designed for creating elegant documentation and static websites, Rspress produces static HTML files that are easy to deploy. Rspress and Docusaurus are quite similar. They both have their pros and cons. Rspress was created more recently and benefits from a modern infrastructure that enables faster site builds. Docusaurus stands out for its maturity, comprehensive feature set, flexibility, and strong community. It is also modernizing its infrastructure regularly to remain competitive in terms of performance. Staying informed ​ GitHub X Blog Discord Something missing? ​ If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please file an issue for us, or send a tweet mentioning the @docusaurus X account. For new feature requests, you can create a post on our feature requests board (Canny) , which is a handy tool for road-mapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!

Once your website is bootstrapped, the website source will contain the Docusaurus scripts that you can invoke with your package manager: package.json { // ... \"scripts\" : { \"docusaurus\" : \"docusaurus\" , \"start\" : \"docusaurus start\" , \"build\" : \"docusaurus build\" , \"swizzle\" : \"docusaurus swizzle\" , \"deploy\" : \"docusaurus deploy\" , \"clear\" : \"docusaurus clear\" , \"serve\" : \"docusaurus serve\" , \"write-translations\" : \"docusaurus write-translations\" , \"write-heading-ids\" : \"docusaurus write-heading-ids\" } } Docusaurus CLI commands ​ Below is a list of Docusaurus CLI commands and their usages: docusaurus start [siteDir] ​ Builds and serves a preview of your site locally with Webpack Dev Server . Options ​ Name Default Description --port 3000 Specifies the port of the dev server. --host localhost Specify a host to use. For example, if you want your server to be accessible externally, you can use --host 0.0.0.0 . --locale Specify site locale to be used. --hot-only false Enables Hot Module Replacement without page refresh as a fallback in case of build failures. More information here . --no-open false Do not open the page automatically in the browser. --config undefined Path to Docusaurus config file, default to [siteDir]/docusaurus.config.js --poll [optionalIntervalMs] false Use polling of files rather than watching for live reload as a fallback in environments where watching doesn't work. More information here . --no-minify false Build website without minimizing JS/CSS bundles. info Please note that some functionality (for example, anchor links) will not work in development. The functionality will work as expected in production. Development over network When forwarding port 3000 from a remote server or VM (e.g. GitHub Codespaces), you can run the dev server on 0.0.0.0 to make it listen on the local IP. npm Yarn pnpm Bun npm run start -- --host 0.0 .0.0 yarn run start --host 0.0 .0.0 pnpm run start --host 0.0 .0.0 bun run start --host 0.0 .0.0 Enabling HTTPS ​ There are multiple ways to obtain a certificate. We will use mkcert as an example. Run mkcert localhost to generate localhost.pem + localhost-key.pem Run mkcert -install to install the cert in your trust store, and restart your browser Start the app with Docusaurus HTTPS env variables: HTTPS = true SSL_CRT_FILE = localhost.pem SSL_KEY_FILE = localhost-key.pem yarn start Open https://localhost:3000/ docusaurus build [siteDir] ​ Compiles your site for production.

They covered how to get started with the project, enable plugins, and set up functionalities like documentation and blogging. Migrating from v1 ​ Docusaurus v2+ has been a total rewrite from Docusaurus v1, taking advantage of a completely modernized toolchain. After v2's official release , we highly encourage you to use Docusaurus v2+ over Docusaurus v1 , as Docusaurus v1 has been deprecated. A lot of users are already using Docusaurus v2+ ( trends ). Use Docusaurus v2+ if: ✅ You want a modern Jamstack documentation site ✅ You want a single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing ✅ You want the full power of React and MDX ✅ You do not need support for IE11 Use Docusaurus v1 if: ❌ You don't want a single-page application (SPA) ❌ You need support for IE11 (...do you? IE has already reached end-of-life and is no longer officially supported) For existing v1 users that are seeking to upgrade to v2+, you can follow our migration guides . Features ​ Docusaurus is built with high attention to the developer and contributor experience. ⚛️ Built with 💚 and React : Extend and customize with React Gain full control of your site's browsing experience by providing your own React components 🔌 Pluggable : Bootstrap your site with a basic template, then use advanced features and plugins Open source your plugins to share with the community ✂️ Developer experience : Start writing your docs right now Universal configuration entry point to make it more maintainable by contributors Hot reloading with lightning-fast incremental build on changes Route-based code and data splitting Publish to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and other deployment services with ease Our shared goal—to help your users quickly find what they need and understand your products better. We share our best practices to help you build your docs site right and well. 🎯 SEO friendly : HTML files are statically generated for every possible path. Page-specific SEO to help your users land on your official docs directly relating their problems at hand. 📝 Powered by MDX : Write interactive components via JSX and React embedded in Markdown. Share your code in live editors to get your users to love your products on the spot. 🔍 Search : Your full site is searchable. 💾 Document Versioning : Helps you keep documentation in sync with project releases. 🌍 Internationalization (i18n) : Translate your site in multiple locales. Docusaurus v2+ is born to be compassionately accessible to all your users, and lightning-fast. ⚡️ Lightning-fast . Docusaurus v2+ follows the PRPL Pattern that makes sure your content loads blazing fast. 🦖 Accessible . Attention to accessibility, making your site equally accessible to all users. Design principles ​ Little to learn . Docusaurus should be easy to learn and use as the API is quite small. Most things will still be achievable by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write. Not having abstractions is better than having the wrong abstractions, and we don't want users to have to hack around the wrong abstractions. Mandatory talk— Minimal API Surface Area . Intuitive . Users will not feel overwhelmed when looking at the project directory of a Docusaurus project or adding new features. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using approaches they are familiar with. Layered architecture . The separations of concerns between each layer of our stack (content/theming/styling) should be clear—well-abstracted and modular. Sensible defaults . Common and popular performance optimizations and configurations will be done for users but they are given the option to override them. No vendor lock-in . Users are not required to use the default plugins or CSS, although they are highly encouraged to. Certain core infrastructures like React Loadable and React Router cannot be swapped because we do default performance optimization on them, but not higher-level ones. Choice of Markdown engines, CSS frameworks, CSS methodology, and other architectures will be entirely up to users. We believe that, as developers, knowing how a library works helps us become better at using it. Hence we're dedicating effort to explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the tool and be even more proficient in using it. Comparison with other tools ​ Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features. We've also studied other main static site generators and would like to share our insights on the comparison, hopefully helping you navigate through the prismatic choices out there. Gatsby ​ Gatsby is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins, and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content. GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don't necessarily need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static websites, you won't need the flexibility that GraphQL provides. Many aspects of Docusaurus v2+ were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it's a great alternative. Docz is a Gatsby theme to build documentation websites. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. Next.js ​ Next.js is another very popular hybrid React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box. Nextra is an opinionated static site generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. VitePress ​ VitePress has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric websites and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VitePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VitePress would be a decent choice. MkDocs ​ MkDocs is a popular Python static site generator with value propositions similar to Docusaurus. It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and don't plan to leverage React. Material for MkDocs is a beautiful theme. Docsify ​ Docsify makes it easy to create a documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO friendly. GitBook ​ GitBook has a very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects' documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus here . Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone. Jekyll ​ Jekyll is one of the most mature static site generators around and has been a great tool to use — in fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook's Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a similar developer experience as building a static site with Jekyll. In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using <script /> tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc sites' performance, asset building pipeline and optimizations, and ease to set up. Rspress ​ Rspress is a fast static site generator based on Rspack, a Rust-based bundler. It supports content writing with MDX (Markdown with React components), integrated text search, multilingual support (i18n), and extensibility through plugins. Designed for creating elegant documentation and static websites, Rspress produces static HTML files that are easy to deploy. Rspress and Docusaurus are quite similar. They both have their pros and cons. Rspress was created more recently and benefits from a modern infrastructure that enables faster site builds. Docusaurus stands out for its maturity, comprehensive feature set, flexibility, and strong community. It is also modernizing its infrastructure regularly to remain competitive in terms of performance. Staying informed ​ GitHub X Blog Discord Something missing? ​ If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please file an issue for us, or send a tweet mentioning the @docusaurus X account. For new feature requests, you can create a post on our feature requests board (Canny) , which is a handy tool for road-mapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!

Many aspects of Docusaurus v2+ were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it's a great alternative. Docz is a Gatsby theme to build documentation websites. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. Next.js ​ Next.js is another very popular hybrid React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box. Nextra is an opinionated static site generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. VitePress ​ VitePress has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric websites and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VitePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VitePress would be a decent choice. MkDocs ​ MkDocs is a popular Python static site generator with value propositions similar to Docusaurus. It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and don't plan to leverage React. Material for MkDocs is a beautiful theme. Docsify ​ Docsify makes it easy to create a documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO friendly. GitBook ​ GitBook has a very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects' documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus here . Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone. Jekyll ​ Jekyll is one of the most mature static site generators around and has been a great tool to use — in fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook's Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a similar developer experience as building a static site with Jekyll. In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using <script /> tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc sites' performance, asset building pipeline and optimizations, and ease to set up. Rspress ​ Rspress is a fast static site generator based on Rspack, a Rust-based bundler. It supports content writing with MDX (Markdown with React components), integrated text search, multilingual support (i18n), and extensibility through plugins. Designed for creating elegant documentation and static websites, Rspress produces static HTML files that are easy to deploy. Rspress and Docusaurus are quite similar. They both have their pros and cons. Rspress was created more recently and benefits from a modern infrastructure that enables faster site builds. Docusaurus stands out for its maturity, comprehensive feature set, flexibility, and strong community. It is also modernizing its infrastructure regularly to remain competitive in terms of performance. Staying informed ​ GitHub X Blog Discord Something missing? ​ If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please file an issue for us, or send a tweet mentioning the @docusaurus X account. For new feature requests, you can create a post on our feature requests board (Canny) , which is a handy tool for road-mapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!

They covered how to get started with the project, enable plugins, and set up functionalities like documentation and blogging. Migrating from v1 ​ Docusaurus v2+ has been a total rewrite from Docusaurus v1, taking advantage of a completely modernized toolchain. After v2's official release , we highly encourage you to use Docusaurus v2+ over Docusaurus v1 , as Docusaurus v1 has been deprecated. A lot of users are already using Docusaurus v2+ ( trends ). Use Docusaurus v2+ if: ✅ You want a modern Jamstack documentation site ✅ You want a single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing ✅ You want the full power of React and MDX ✅ You do not need support for IE11 Use Docusaurus v1 if: ❌ You don't want a single-page application (SPA) ❌ You need support for IE11 (...do you? IE has already reached end-of-life and is no longer officially supported) For existing v1 users that are seeking to upgrade to v2+, you can follow our migration guides . Features ​ Docusaurus is built with high attention to the developer and contributor experience. ⚛️ Built with 💚 and React : Extend and customize with React Gain full control of your site's browsing experience by providing your own React components 🔌 Pluggable : Bootstrap your site with a basic template, then use advanced features and plugins Open source your plugins to share with the community ✂️ Developer experience : Start writing your docs right now Universal configuration entry point to make it more maintainable by contributors Hot reloading with lightning-fast incremental build on changes Route-based code and data splitting Publish to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and other deployment services with ease Our shared goal—to help your users quickly find what they need and understand your products better. We share our best practices to help you build your docs site right and well. 🎯 SEO friendly : HTML files are statically generated for every possible path. Page-specific SEO to help your users land on your official docs directly relating their problems at hand. 📝 Powered by MDX : Write interactive components via JSX and React embedded in Markdown. Share your code in live editors to get your users to love your products on the spot. 🔍 Search : Your full site is searchable. 💾 Document Versioning : Helps you keep documentation in sync with project releases. 🌍 Internationalization (i18n) : Translate your site in multiple locales. Docusaurus v2+ is born to be compassionately accessible to all your users, and lightning-fast. ⚡️ Lightning-fast . Docusaurus v2+ follows the PRPL Pattern that makes sure your content loads blazing fast. 🦖 Accessible . Attention to accessibility, making your site equally accessible to all users. Design principles ​ Little to learn . Docusaurus should be easy to learn and use as the API is quite small. Most things will still be achievable by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write. Not having abstractions is better than having the wrong abstractions, and we don't want users to have to hack around the wrong abstractions. Mandatory talk— Minimal API Surface Area . Intuitive . Users will not feel overwhelmed when looking at the project directory of a Docusaurus project or adding new features. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using approaches they are familiar with. Layered architecture . The separations of concerns between each layer of our stack (content/theming/styling) should be clear—well-abstracted and modular. Sensible defaults . Common and popular performance optimizations and configurations will be done for users but they are given the option to override them. No vendor lock-in . Users are not required to use the default plugins or CSS, although they are highly encouraged to. Certain core infrastructures like React Loadable and React Router cannot be swapped because we do default performance optimization on them, but not higher-level ones. Choice of Markdown engines, CSS frameworks, CSS methodology, and other architectures will be entirely up to users. We believe that, as developers, knowing how a library works helps us become better at using it. Hence we're dedicating effort to explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the tool and be even more proficient in using it. Comparison with other tools ​ Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features. We've also studied other main static site generators and would like to share our insights on the comparison, hopefully helping you navigate through the prismatic choices out there. Gatsby ​ Gatsby is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins, and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content. GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don't necessarily need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static websites, you won't need the flexibility that GraphQL provides. Many aspects of Docusaurus v2+ were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it's a great alternative. Docz is a Gatsby theme to build documentation websites. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. Next.js ​ Next.js is another very popular hybrid React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box. Nextra is an opinionated static site generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. VitePress ​ VitePress has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric websites and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VitePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VitePress would be a decent choice. MkDocs ​ MkDocs is a popular Python static site generator with value propositions similar to Docusaurus. It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and don't plan to leverage React. Material for MkDocs is a beautiful theme. Docsify ​ Docsify makes it easy to create a documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO friendly. GitBook ​ GitBook has a very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects' documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus here . Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone.

They covered how to get started with the project, enable plugins, and set up functionalities like documentation and blogging. Migrating from v1 ​ Docusaurus v2+ has been a total rewrite from Docusaurus v1, taking advantage of a completely modernized toolchain. After v2's official release , we highly encourage you to use Docusaurus v2+ over Docusaurus v1 , as Docusaurus v1 has been deprecated. A lot of users are already using Docusaurus v2+ ( trends ). Use Docusaurus v2+ if: ✅ You want a modern Jamstack documentation site ✅ You want a single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing ✅ You want the full power of React and MDX ✅ You do not need support for IE11 Use Docusaurus v1 if: ❌ You don't want a single-page application (SPA) ❌ You need support for IE11 (...do you? IE has already reached end-of-life and is no longer officially supported) For existing v1 users that are seeking to upgrade to v2+, you can follow our migration guides . Features ​ Docusaurus is built with high attention to the developer and contributor experience. ⚛️ Built with 💚 and React : Extend and customize with React Gain full control of your site's browsing experience by providing your own React components 🔌 Pluggable : Bootstrap your site with a basic template, then use advanced features and plugins Open source your plugins to share with the community ✂️ Developer experience : Start writing your docs right now Universal configuration entry point to make it more maintainable by contributors Hot reloading with lightning-fast incremental build on changes Route-based code and data splitting Publish to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and other deployment services with ease Our shared goal—to help your users quickly find what they need and understand your products better. We share our best practices to help you build your docs site right and well. 🎯 SEO friendly : HTML files are statically generated for every possible path. Page-specific SEO to help your users land on your official docs directly relating their problems at hand. 📝 Powered by MDX : Write interactive components via JSX and React embedded in Markdown. Share your code in live editors to get your users to love your products on the spot. 🔍 Search : Your full site is searchable. 💾 Document Versioning : Helps you keep documentation in sync with project releases. 🌍 Internationalization (i18n) : Translate your site in multiple locales. Docusaurus v2+ is born to be compassionately accessible to all your users, and lightning-fast. ⚡️ Lightning-fast . Docusaurus v2+ follows the PRPL Pattern that makes sure your content loads blazing fast. 🦖 Accessible . Attention to accessibility, making your site equally accessible to all users. Design principles ​ Little to learn . Docusaurus should be easy to learn and use as the API is quite small. Most things will still be achievable by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write. Not having abstractions is better than having the wrong abstractions, and we don't want users to have to hack around the wrong abstractions. Mandatory talk— Minimal API Surface Area . Intuitive . Users will not feel overwhelmed when looking at the project directory of a Docusaurus project or adding new features. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using approaches they are familiar with. Layered architecture . The separations of concerns between each layer of our stack (content/theming/styling) should be clear—well-abstracted and modular. Sensible defaults . Common and popular performance optimizations and configurations will be done for users but they are given the option to override them. No vendor lock-in . Users are not required to use the default plugins or CSS, although they are highly encouraged to. Certain core infrastructures like React Loadable and React Router cannot be swapped because we do default performance optimization on them, but not higher-level ones. Choice of Markdown engines, CSS frameworks, CSS methodology, and other architectures will be entirely up to users. We believe that, as developers, knowing how a library works helps us become better at using it. Hence we're dedicating effort to explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the tool and be even more proficient in using it. Comparison with other tools ​ Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features. We've also studied other main static site generators and would like to share our insights on the comparison, hopefully helping you navigate through the prismatic choices out there. Gatsby ​ Gatsby is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins, and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content. GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don't necessarily need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static websites, you won't need the flexibility that GraphQL provides. Many aspects of Docusaurus v2+ were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it's a great alternative. Docz is a Gatsby theme to build documentation websites. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. Next.js ​ Next.js is another very popular hybrid React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box. Nextra is an opinionated static site generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. VitePress ​ VitePress has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric websites and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VitePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VitePress would be a decent choice. MkDocs ​ MkDocs is a popular Python static site generator with value propositions similar to Docusaurus. It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and don't plan to leverage React. Material for MkDocs is a beautiful theme. Docsify ​ Docsify makes it easy to create a documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO friendly. GitBook ​ GitBook has a very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects' documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus here . Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone. Jekyll ​ Jekyll is one of the most mature static site generators around and has been a great tool to use — in fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook's Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a similar developer experience as building a static site with Jekyll. In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using <script /> tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc sites' performance, asset building pipeline and optimizations, and ease to set up. Staying informed ​ GitHub X Blog Discord Something missing? ​ If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please file an issue for us, or send a tweet mentioning the @docusaurus X account. For new feature requests, you can create a post on our feature requests board (Canny) , which is a handy tool for road-mapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!

They covered how to get started with the project, enable plugins, and set up functionalities like documentation and blogging. Migrating from v1 ​ Docusaurus v2+ has been a total rewrite from Docusaurus v1, taking advantage of a completely modernized toolchain. After v2's official release , we highly encourage you to use Docusaurus v2+ over Docusaurus v1 , as Docusaurus v1 has been deprecated. A lot of users are already using Docusaurus v2+ ( trends ). Use Docusaurus v2+ if: ✅ You want a modern Jamstack documentation site ✅ You want a single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing ✅ You want the full power of React and MDX ✅ You do not need support for IE11 Use Docusaurus v1 if: ❌ You don't want a single-page application (SPA) ❌ You need support for IE11 (...do you? IE has already reached end-of-life and is no longer officially supported) For existing v1 users that are seeking to upgrade to v2+, you can follow our migration guides . Features ​ Docusaurus is built with high attention to the developer and contributor experience. ⚛️ Built with 💚 and React : Extend and customize with React Gain full control of your site's browsing experience by providing your own React components Pluggable : Bootstrap your site with a basic template, then use advanced features and plugins Open source your plugins to share with the community ✂️ Developer experience : Start writing your docs right now Universal configuration entry point to make it more maintainable by contributors Hot reloading with lightning-fast incremental build on changes Route-based code and data splitting Publish to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and other deployment services with ease Our shared goal—to help your users quickly find what they need and understand your products better. We share our best practices to help you build your docs site right and well. 🎯 SEO friendly : HTML files are statically generated for every possible path. Page-specific SEO to help your users land on your official docs directly relating their problems at hand. 📝 Powered by MDX : Write interactive components via JSX and React embedded in Markdown. Share your code in live editors to get your users to love your products on the spot. 🔍 Search : Your full site is searchable. 💾 Document Versioning : Helps you keep documentation in sync with project releases. 🌍 Internationalization (i18n) : Translate your site in multiple locales. Docusaurus v2+ is born to be compassionately accessible to all your users, and lightning-fast. ⚡️ Lightning-fast . Docusaurus v2+ follows the PRPL Pattern that makes sure your content loads blazing fast. 🦖 Accessible . Attention to accessibility, making your site equally accessible to all users. Design principles ​ Little to learn . Docusaurus should be easy to learn and use as the API is quite small. Most things will still be achievable by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write. Not having abstractions is better than having the wrong abstractions, and we don't want users to have to hack around the wrong abstractions. Mandatory talk— Minimal API Surface Area . Intuitive . Users will not feel overwhelmed when looking at the project directory of a Docusaurus project or adding new features. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using approaches they are familiar with. Layered architecture . The separations of concerns between each layer of our stack (content/theming/styling) should be clear—well-abstracted and modular. Sensible defaults . Common and popular performance optimizations and configurations will be done for users but they are given the option to override them. No vendor lock-in . Users are not required to use the default plugins or CSS, although they are highly encouraged to. Certain core infrastructures like React Loadable and React Router cannot be swapped because we do default performance optimization on them, but not higher-level ones. Choice of Markdown engines, CSS frameworks, CSS methodology, and other architectures will be entirely up to users. We believe that, as developers, knowing how a library works helps us become better at using it. Hence we're dedicating effort to explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the tool and be even more proficient in using it. Comparison with other tools ​ Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features. We've also studied other main static site generators and would like to share our insights on the comparison, hopefully helping you navigate through the prismatic choices out there. Gatsby ​ Gatsby is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins, and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content. GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don't necessarily need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static websites, you won't need the flexibility that GraphQL provides. Many aspects of Docusaurus v2+ were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it's a great alternative. Docz is a Gatsby theme to build documentation websites. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. Next.js ​ Next.js is another very popular hybrid React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box. Nextra is an opinionated static site generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. VitePress ​ VitePress has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric websites and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VitePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VitePress would be a decent choice. MkDocs ​ MkDocs is a popular Python static site generator with value propositions similar to Docusaurus. It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and don't plan to leverage React. Material for MkDocs is a beautiful theme. Docsify ​ Docsify makes it easy to create a documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO friendly. GitBook ​ GitBook has a very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects' documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus here . Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone. Jekyll ​ Jekyll is one of the most mature static site generators around and has been a great tool to use — in fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook's Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a similar developer experience as building a static site with Jekyll. In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using <script /> tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc sites' performance, asset building pipeline and optimizations, and ease to set up. Staying informed ​ GitHub X Blog Discord Something missing? ​ If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please file an issue for us, or send a tweet mentioning the @docusaurus X account. For new feature requests, you can create a post on our feature requests board (Canny) , which is a handy tool for road-mapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!

It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and don't plan to leverage React. Material for MkDocs is a beautiful theme. Docsify ​ Docsify makes it easy to create a documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO friendly. GitBook ​ GitBook has a very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects' documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus here . Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone. Jekyll ​ Jekyll is one of the most mature static site generators around and has been a great tool to use — in fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook's Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a similar developer experience as building a static site with Jekyll. In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using <script /> tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc sites' performance, asset building pipeline and optimizations, and ease to set up. Staying informed ​ GitHub X Blog Discord Something missing? ​ If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please file an issue for us, or send a tweet mentioning the @docusaurus X account. For new feature requests, you can create a post on our feature requests board (Canny) , which is a handy tool for road-mapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!

Or read the 5-minute tutorial online. Docusaurus: Documentation Made Easy ​ In this presentation at Algolia Community Event , Meta Open Source team shared a brief walk-through of Docusaurus. They covered how to get started with the project, enable plugins, and set up functionalities like documentation and blogging. Migrating from v1 ​ Docusaurus v2+ has been a total rewrite from Docusaurus v1, taking advantage of a completely modernized toolchain. After v2's official release , we highly encourage you to use Docusaurus v2+ over Docusaurus v1 , as Docusaurus v1 has been deprecated. A lot of users are already using Docusaurus v2+ ( trends ). Use Docusaurus v2+ if: ✅ You want a modern Jamstack documentation site ✅ You want a single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing ✅ You want the full power of React and MDX ✅ You do not need support for IE11 Use Docusaurus v1 if: ❌ You don't want a single-page application (SPA) ❌ You need support for IE11 (...do you? IE has already reached end-of-life and is no longer officially supported) For existing v1 users that are seeking to upgrade to v2+, you can follow our migration guides . Features ​ Docusaurus is built with high attention to the developer and contributor experience. ⚛️ Built with 💚 and React : Extend and customize with React Gain full control of your site's browsing experience by providing your own React components Pluggable : Bootstrap your site with a basic template, then use advanced features and plugins Open source your plugins to share with the community ✂️ Developer experience : Start writing your docs right now Universal configuration entry point to make it more maintainable by contributors Hot reloading with lightning-fast incremental build on changes Route-based code and data splitting Publish to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and other deployment services with ease Our shared goal—to help your users quickly find what they need and understand your products better. We share our best practices to help you build your docs site right and well. 🎯 SEO friendly : HTML files are statically generated for every possible path. Page-specific SEO to help your users land on your official docs directly relating their problems at hand. 📝 Powered by MDX : Write interactive components via JSX and React embedded in Markdown. Share your code in live editors to get your users to love your products on the spot. 🔍 Search : Your full site is searchable. 💾 Document Versioning : Helps you keep documentation in sync with project releases. 🌍 Internationalization (i18n) : Translate your site in multiple locales. Docusaurus v2+ is born to be compassionately accessible to all your users, and lightning-fast. ⚡️ Lightning-fast . Docusaurus v2+ follows the PRPL Pattern that makes sure your content loads blazing fast. 🦖 Accessible . Attention to accessibility, making your site equally accessible to all users. Design principles ​ Little to learn . Docusaurus should be easy to learn and use as the API is quite small. Most things will still be achievable by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write. Not having abstractions is better than having the wrong abstractions, and we don't want users to have to hack around the wrong abstractions. Mandatory talk— Minimal API Surface Area . Intuitive . Users will not feel overwhelmed when looking at the project directory of a Docusaurus project or adding new features. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using approaches they are familiar with. Layered architecture . The separations of concerns between each layer of our stack (content/theming/styling) should be clear—well-abstracted and modular. Sensible defaults . Common and popular performance optimizations and configurations will be done for users but they are given the option to override them. No vendor lock-in . Users are not required to use the default plugins or CSS, although they are highly encouraged to. Certain core infrastructures like React Loadable and React Router cannot be swapped because we do default performance optimization on them, but not higher-level ones. Choice of Markdown engines, CSS frameworks, CSS methodology, and other architectures will be entirely up to users. We believe that, as developers, knowing how a library works helps us become better at using it. Hence we're dedicating effort to explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the tool and be even more proficient in using it. Comparison with other tools ​ Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features. We've also studied other main static site generators and would like to share our insights on the comparison, hopefully helping you navigate through the prismatic choices out there. Gatsby ​ Gatsby is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins, and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content. GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don't necessarily need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static websites, you won't need the flexibility that GraphQL provides. Many aspects of Docusaurus v2+ were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it's a great alternative. Docz is a Gatsby theme to build documentation websites. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. Next.js ​ Next.js is another very popular hybrid React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box. Nextra is an opinionated static site generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. VitePress ​ VitePress has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric websites and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VitePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VitePress would be a decent choice. MkDocs ​ MkDocs is a popular Python static site generator with value propositions similar to Docusaurus. It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and don't plan to leverage React. Material for MkDocs is a beautiful theme. Docsify ​ Docsify makes it easy to create a documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO friendly. GitBook ​ GitBook has a very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects' documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus here . Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams.

They covered how to get started with the project, enable plugins, and set up functionalities like documentation and blogging. Migrating from v1 ​ Docusaurus v2+ has been a total rewrite from Docusaurus v1, taking advantage of a completely modernized toolchain. After v2's official release , we highly encourage you to use Docusaurus v2+ over Docusaurus v1 , as Docusaurus v1 has been deprecated. A lot of users are already using Docusaurus v2+ ( trends ). Use Docusaurus v2+ if: ✅ You want a modern Jamstack documentation site ✅ You want a single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing ✅ You want the full power of React and MDX ✅ You do not need support for IE11 Use Docusaurus v1 if: ❌ You don't want a single-page application (SPA) ❌ You need support for IE11 (...do you? IE has already reached end-of-life and is no longer officially supported) For existing v1 users that are seeking to upgrade to v2+, you can follow our migration guides . Features ​ Docusaurus is built with high attention to the developer and contributor experience. ⚛️ Built with 💚 and React : Extend and customize with React Gain full control of your site's browsing experience by providing your own React components Pluggable : Bootstrap your site with a basic template, then use advanced features and plugins Open source your plugins to share with the community ✂️ Developer experience : Start writing your docs right now Universal configuration entry point to make it more maintainable by contributors Hot reloading with lightning-fast incremental build on changes Route-based code and data splitting Publish to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and other deployment services with ease Our shared goal—to help your users quickly find what they need and understand your products better. We share our best practices to help you build your docs site right and well. 🎯 SEO friendly : HTML files are statically generated for every possible path. Page-specific SEO to help your users land on your official docs directly relating their problems at hand. 📝 Powered by MDX : Write interactive components via JSX and React embedded in Markdown. Share your code in live editors to get your users to love your products on the spot. 🔍 Search : Your full site is searchable. 💾 Document Versioning : Helps you keep documentation in sync with project releases. 🌍 Internationalization (i18n) : Translate your site in multiple locales. Docusaurus v2+ is born to be compassionately accessible to all your users, and lightning-fast. ⚡️ Lightning-fast . Docusaurus v2+ follows the PRPL Pattern that makes sure your content loads blazing fast. 🦖 Accessible . Attention to accessibility, making your site equally accessible to all users. Design principles ​ Little to learn . Docusaurus should be easy to learn and use as the API is quite small. Most things will still be achievable by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write. Not having abstractions is better than having the wrong abstractions, and we don't want users to have to hack around the wrong abstractions. Mandatory talk— Minimal API Surface Area . Intuitive . Users will not feel overwhelmed when looking at the project directory of a Docusaurus project or adding new features. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using approaches they are familiar with. Layered architecture . The separations of concerns between each layer of our stack (content/theming/styling) should be clear—well-abstracted and modular. Sensible defaults . Common and popular performance optimizations and configurations will be done for users but they are given the option to override them. No vendor lock-in . Users are not required to use the default plugins or CSS, although they are highly encouraged to. Certain core infrastructures like React Loadable and React Router cannot be swapped because we do default performance optimization on them, but not higher-level ones. Choice of Markdown engines, CSS frameworks, CSS methodology, and other architectures will be entirely up to users. We believe that, as developers, knowing how a library works helps us become better at using it. Hence we're dedicating effort to explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the tool and be even more proficient in using it. Comparison with other tools ​ Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features. We've also studied other main static site generators and would like to share our insights on the comparison, hopefully helping you navigate through the prismatic choices out there. Gatsby ​ Gatsby is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins, and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content. GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don't necessarily need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static websites, you won't need the flexibility that GraphQL provides. Many aspects of Docusaurus v2+ were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it's a great alternative. Docz is a Gatsby theme to build documentation websites. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. Next.js ​ Next.js is another very popular hybrid React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box. Nextra is an opinionated static site generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. VuePress ​ VuePress has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric website and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VuePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VuePress would be a decent choice. MkDocs ​ MkDocs is a popular Python static site generator with value propositions similar to Docusaurus. It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and don't plan to leverage React. Material for MkDocs is a beautiful theme. Docsify ​ Docsify makes it easy to create a documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO friendly. GitBook ​ GitBook has a very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects' documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus here . Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone. Jekyll ​ Jekyll is one of the most mature static site generators around and has been a great tool to use — in fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook's Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a similar developer experience as building a static site with Jekyll. In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using <script /> tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc sites' performance, asset building pipeline and optimizations, and ease to set up. Staying informed ​ GitHub X Blog Discord Something missing? ​ If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please file an issue for us, or send a tweet mentioning the @docusaurus X account. For new feature requests, you can create a post on our feature requests board (Canny) , which is a handy tool for road-mapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!

Or read the 5-minute tutorial online. Docusaurus: Documentation Made Easy ​ In this presentation at Algolia Community Event , Meta Open Source team shared a brief walk-through of Docusaurus. They covered how to get started with the project, enable plugins, and set up functionalities like documentation and blogging. Migrating from v1 ​ Docusaurus v2 has been a total rewrite from Docusaurus v1, taking advantage of a completely modernized toolchain. After v2's official release , we highly encourage you to use Docusaurus v2 over Docusaurus v1 , as Docusaurus v1 has been deprecated. A lot of users are already using Docusaurus v2 ( trends ). Use Docusaurus v2 if: ✅ You want a modern Jamstack documentation site ✅ You want a single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing ✅ You want the full power of React and MDX ✅ You do not need support for IE11 Use Docusaurus v1 if: ❌ You don't want a single-page application (SPA) ❌ You need support for IE11 (...do you? IE has already reached end-of-life and is no longer officially supported) For existing v1 users that are seeking to upgrade to v2, you can follow our migration guide . Features ​ Docusaurus is built with high attention to the developer and contributor experience. ⚛️ Built with 💚 and React : Extend and customize with React Gain full control of your site's browsing experience by providing your own React components Pluggable : Bootstrap your site with a basic template, then use advanced features and plugins Open source your plugins to share with the community ✂️ Developer experience : Start writing your docs right now Universal configuration entry point to make it more maintainable by contributors Hot reloading with lightning-fast incremental build on changes Route-based code and data splitting Publish to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, and other deployment services with ease Our shared goal—to help your users quickly find what they need and understand your products better. We share our best practices to help you build your docs site right and well. 🎯 SEO friendly : HTML files are statically generated for every possible path. Page-specific SEO to help your users land on your official docs directly relating their problems at hand. 📝 Powered by MDX : Write interactive components via JSX and React embedded in Markdown. Share your code in live editors to get your users to love your products on the spot. 🔍 Search : Your full site is searchable. 💾 Document Versioning : Helps you keep documentation in sync with project releases. 🌍 Internationalization (i18n) : Translate your site in multiple locales. Docusaurus 2 is born to be compassionately accessible to all your users, and lightning-fast. ⚡️ Lightning-fast . Docusaurus 2 follows the PRPL Pattern that makes sure your content loads blazing fast. 🦖 Accessible . Attention to accessibility, making your site equally accessible to all users. Design principles ​ Little to learn . Docusaurus should be easy to learn and use as the API is quite small. Most things will still be achievable by users, even if it takes them more code and more time to write. Not having abstractions is better than having the wrong abstractions, and we don't want users to have to hack around the wrong abstractions. Mandatory talk— Minimal API Surface Area . Intuitive . Users will not feel overwhelmed when looking at the project directory of a Docusaurus project or adding new features. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using approaches they are familiar with. Layered architecture . The separations of concerns between each layer of our stack (content/theming/styling) should be clear—well-abstracted and modular. Sensible defaults . Common and popular performance optimizations and configurations will be done for users but they are given the option to override them. No vendor lock-in . Users are not required to use the default plugins or CSS, although they are highly encouraged to. Certain core infrastructures like React Loadable and React Router cannot be swapped because we do default performance optimization on them, but not higher-level ones. Choice of Markdown engines, CSS frameworks, CSS methodology, and other architectures will be entirely up to users. We believe that, as developers, knowing how a library works helps us become better at using it. Hence we're dedicating effort to explaining the architecture and various components of Docusaurus with the hope that users reading it will gain a deeper understanding of the tool and be even more proficient in using it. Comparison with other tools ​ Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on documentation sites and has many out-of-the-box features. We've also studied other main static site generators and would like to share our insights on the comparison, hopefully helping you navigate through the prismatic choices out there. Gatsby ​ Gatsby is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins, and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content. GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don't necessarily need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static websites, you won't need the flexibility that GraphQL provides. Many aspects of Docusaurus 2 were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it's a great alternative. Docz is a Gatsby theme to build documentation websites. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. Next.js ​ Next.js is another very popular hybrid React framework. It can help you build a good documentation website, but it is not opinionated toward the documentation use-case, and it will require a lot more work to implement what Docusaurus provides out-of-the-box. Nextra is an opinionated static site generator built on top of Next.js. It is currently less featured than Docusaurus. VuePress ​ VuePress has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric website and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VuePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VuePress would be a decent choice. MkDocs ​ MkDocs is a popular Python static site generator with value propositions similar to Docusaurus. It is a good option if you don't need a single-page application and don't plan to leverage React. Material for MkDocs is a beautiful theme. Docsify ​ Docsify makes it easy to create a documentation website, but is not a static-site generator and is not SEO friendly. GitBook ​ GitBook has a very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs of open source projects' documentation sites. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux's switch to Docusaurus here . Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone. Jekyll ​ Jekyll is one of the most mature static site generators around and has been a great tool to use — in fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook's Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a similar developer experience as building a static site with Jekyll. In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using <script /> tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc sites' performance, asset building pipeline and optimizations, and ease to set up. Staying informed ​ GitHub X Blog Discord Something missing? ​ If you find issues with the documentation or have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or the project in general, please file an issue for us, or send a tweet mentioning the @docusaurus X account. For new feature requests, you can create a post on our feature requests board (Canny) , which is a handy tool for road-mapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!

Use docusaurus.new to test Docusaurus immediately in your browser! Requirements ​ Node.js version 20.0 or above (which can be checked by running node -v ). You can use nvm to manage multiple Node.js versions on a single machine. When installing Node.js, it is recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies. Scaffold project website ​ The easiest way to install Docusaurus is to use the create-docusaurus command line tool that helps you scaffold a skeleton Docusaurus website. You can run this command anywhere in a new empty repository or within an existing repository, it will create a new directory containing the scaffolded files. npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic We recommend the classic template so that you can get started quickly, and it contains features found in Docusaurus 1. The classic template contains @docusaurus/preset-classic which includes standard documentation, a blog, custom pages, and a CSS framework (with dark mode support). You can get up and running extremely quickly with the classic template and customize things later on when you have gained more familiarity with Docusaurus. You can also use the template's TypeScript variant by passing the --typescript flag. See TypeScript support for more information. npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic --typescript Meta-Only If you are setting up a new Docusaurus website for a Meta open source project, run this command inside an internal repository, which comes with some useful Meta-specific defaults: scarf static-docs-bootstrap Alternative installation commands You can also initialize a new project using your preferred project manager: npm Yarn pnpm Bun npm init docusaurus yarn create docusaurus pnpm create docusaurus bunx create-docusaurus Run npx create-docusaurus@latest --help , or check out its API docs for more information about all available flags. Project structure ​ Assuming you chose the classic template and named your site my-website , you will see the following files generated under a new directory my-website/ : my-website ├── blog │ ├── 2019 -05-28-hola.md │ ├── 2019 -05-29-hello-world.md │ └── 2020 -05-30-welcome.md ├── docs │ ├── doc1.md │ ├── doc2.md │ ├── doc3.md │ └── mdx.md ├── src │ ├── css │ │ └── custom.css │ └── pages │ ├── styles.module.css │ └── index.js ├── static │ └── img ├── docusaurus.config.js ├── package.json ├── README.md ├── sidebars.js └── yarn.lock Project structure rundown ​ /blog/ - Contains the blog Markdown files. You can delete the directory if you've disabled the blog plugin, or you can change its name after setting the path option. More details can be found in the blog guide /docs/ - Contains the Markdown files for the docs. Customize the order of the docs sidebar in sidebars.js . You can delete the directory if you've disabled the docs plugin, or you can change its name after setting the path option. More details can be found in the docs guide /src/ - Non-documentation files like pages or custom React components. You don't have to strictly put your non-documentation files here, but putting them under a centralized directory makes it easier to specify in case you need to do some sort of linting/processing /src/pages - Any JSX/TSX/MDX file within this directory will be converted into a website page. More details can be found in the pages guide /static/ - Static directory. Any contents inside here will be copied into the root of the final build directory /docusaurus.config.js - A config file containing the site configuration. This is the equivalent of siteConfig.js in Docusaurus v1 /package.json - A Docusaurus website is a React app. You can install and use any npm packages you like in them /sidebars.js - Used by the documentation to specify the order of documents in the sidebar Monorepos ​ If you are using Docusaurus for documentation of an existing project, a monorepo may be the solution for you. Monorepos allow you to share dependencies between similar projects. For example, your website may use your local packages to showcase latest features instead of depending on a released version. Then, your contributors can update the docs as they implement features. An example monorepo folder structure is below: my-monorepo ├── package-a # Another package, your actual project │ ├── src │ └── package.json # Package A's dependencies ├── website # Docusaurus root │ ├── docs │ ├── src │ └── package.json # Docusaurus' dependencies ├── package.json # Monorepo's shared dependencies In this case, you should run npx create-docusaurus within the ./my-monorepo folder. If you're using a hosting provider such as Netlify or Vercel, you will need to change the Base directory of the site to where your Docusaurus root is. In this case, that would be ./website . Read more about configuring ignore commands in the deployment docs . Read more about monorepos in the Yarn documentation (Yarn is not the only way to set up a monorepo, but it's a common solution), or checkout Docusaurus and Jest for some real-world examples. Running the development server ​ To preview your changes as you edit the files, you can run a local development server that will serve your website and reflect the latest changes. npm Yarn pnpm Bun cd my-website npm run start cd my-website yarn run start cd my-website pnpm run start cd my-website bun run start By default, a browser window will open at http://localhost:3000 . Congratulations! You have just created your first Docusaurus site! Browse around the site to see what's available. Build ​ Docusaurus is a modern static website generator so we need to build the website into a directory of static contents and put it on a web server so that it can be viewed. To build the website: npm Yarn pnpm Bun npm run build yarn build pnpm run build bun run build and contents will be generated within the /build directory, which can be copied to any static file hosting service like GitHub pages , Vercel or Netlify . Check out the docs on deployment for more details. Updating your Docusaurus version ​ There are many ways to update your Docusaurus version. One guaranteed way is to manually change the version number in package.json to the desired version. Note that all @docusaurus/ -namespaced packages should be using the same version. package.json { \"dependencies\" : { \"@docusaurus/core\" : \"3.9.2\" , \"@docusaurus/preset-classic\" : \"3.9.2\" , // ... } } Then, in the directory containing package.json , run your package manager's install command: npm Yarn pnpm Bun npm install yarn install pnpm install bun install tip npm install may report several vulnerabilities and recommend running npm audit to address them. Typically, these reported vulnerabilities, such as RegExp DOS vulnerabilities, are harmless and can be safely ignored. Also read this article, which reflects our thinking: npm audit: Broken by Design . To check that the update occurred successfully, run: npx docusaurus --version You should see the correct version as output. Alternatively, if you are using Yarn, you can do: yarn add @docusaurus/core @docusaurus/preset-classic tip Use new unreleased features of Docusaurus with the @canary npm dist tag Problems? ​ Ask for help on Stack Overflow , on our GitHub repository , our Discord server , or X .

      "text_content": "Version: 3.9.2 info Check the docusaurus.config.js API reference for an exhaustive list of options. Docusaurus has a unique take on configurations. We encourage you to congregate information about your site into one place. We guard the fields of this file and facilitate making this data object accessible across your site. Keeping a well-maintained docusaurus.config.js helps you, your collaborators, and your open source contributors to be able to focus on documentation while still being able to customize the site. Syntax to declare docusaurus.config.js ​ The docusaurus.config.js file is run in Node.js and should export either: a config object a function that creates the config object info The docusaurus.config.js file supports: ES Modules CommonJS TypeScript Constraints: Required: use export default /* your config*/ (or module.exports ) to export your Docusaurus config Optional: use import Lib from 'lib' (or require('lib') ) to import Node.js packages Docusaurus gives us the ability to declare its configuration in various equivalent ways , and all the following config examples lead to the exact same result: docusaurus.config.js export default { title : 'Docusaurus' , url : 'https://docusaurus.io' , // your site config ... } ; docusaurus.config.js module . exports = { title : 'Docusaurus' , url : 'https://docusaurus.io' , // your site config ... } ; docusaurus.config.ts import type { Config } from '@docusaurus/types' ; export default { title : 'Docusaurus' , url : 'https://docusaurus.io' , // your site config ... } satisfies Config ; docusaurus.config.js const config = { title : 'Docusaurus' , url : 'https://docusaurus.io' , // your site config ... } ; export default config ; docusaurus.config.js export default function configCreator ( ) { return { title : 'Docusaurus' , url : 'https://docusaurus.io' , // your site config ... } ; } docusaurus.config.js export default async function createConfigAsync ( ) { return { title : 'Docusaurus' , url : 'https://docusaurus.io' , // your site config ... } ; } Using ESM-only packages Using an async config creator can be useful to import ESM-only modules (notably most Remark plugins). It is possible to import such modules thanks to dynamic imports: docusaurus.config.js export default async function createConfigAsync ( ) { // Use a dynamic import instead of require('esm-lib') const lib = await import ( 'lib' ) ; return { title : 'Docusaurus' , url : 'https://docusaurus.io' , // rest of your site config... } ; } What goes into a docusaurus.config.js ? ​ You should not have to write your docusaurus.config.js from scratch even if you are developing your site. All templates come with a docusaurus.config.js that includes defaults for the common options. However, it can be helpful if you have a high-level understanding of how the configurations are designed and implemented. The high-level overview of Docusaurus configuration can be categorized into: Site metadata Deployment configurations Theme, plugin, and preset configurations Custom configurations Site metadata ​ Site metadata contains the essential global metadata such as title , url , baseUrl , and favicon . They are used in several places such as your site's title and headings, browser tab icon, social sharing (Facebook, X) information or even to generate the correct path to serve your static files. Deployment configurations ​ Deployment configurations such as projectName , organizationName , and optionally deploymentBranch are used when you deploy your site with the deploy command. It is recommended to check the deployment docs for more information. Theme, plugin, and preset configurations ​ List the themes , plugins , and presets for your site in the themes , plugins , and presets fields, respectively. These are typically npm packages: docusaurus.config.js export default { // ... plugins : [ '@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog' , '@docusaurus/plugin-content-pages' , ] , themes : [ '@docusaurus/theme-classic' ] , } ; tip Docusaurus supports module shorthands , allowing you to simplify the above configuration as: docusaurus.config.js export default { // ... plugins : [ 'content-blog' , 'content-pages' ] , themes : [ 'classic' ] , } ; They can also be loaded from local directories: docusaurus.config.js import path from 'path' ; export default { // ... themes : [ path . resolve ( __dirname , '/path/to/docusaurus-local-theme' ) ] , } ; To specify options for a plugin or theme, replace the name of the plugin or theme in the config file with an array containing the name and an options object: docusaurus.config.js export default { // ... plugins : [ [ 'content-blog' , { path : 'blog' , routeBasePath : 'blog' , include : [ '*.md' , '*.mdx' ] , // ... } , ] , 'content-pages' , ] , } ; To specify options for a plugin or theme that is bundled in a preset, pass the options through the presets field. In this example, docs refers to @docusaurus/plugin-content-docs and theme refers to @docusaurus/theme-classic . docusaurus.config.js export default { // ... presets : [ [ '@docusaurus/preset-classic' , { docs : { sidebarPath : './sidebars.js' , } , theme : { customCss : [ './src/css/custom.css' ] , } , } , ] , ] , } ; tip The presets: [['classic', {...}]] shorthand works as well. For further help configuring themes, plugins, and presets, see Using Plugins . Custom configurations ​ Docusaurus guards docusaurus.config.js from unknown fields. To add custom fields, define them in customFields . Example: docusaurus.config.js export default { // ... customFields : { image : '' , keywords : [ ] , } , // ... } ; Accessing configuration from components ​ Your configuration object will be made available to all the components of your site. And you may access them via React context as siteConfig . Basic example: import React from 'react' ; import useDocusaurusContext from '@docusaurus/useDocusaurusContext' ; const Hello = ( ) => { const { siteConfig } = useDocusaurusContext ( ) ; const { title , tagline } = siteConfig ; return < div > { ` ${ title } · ${ tagline } ` } </ div > ; } ; tip If you just want to use those fields on the client side, you could create your own JS files and import them as ES6 modules, there is no need to put them in docusaurus.config.js . Customizing Babel Configuration ​ Docusaurus transpiles your site's source code using Babel by default. If you want to customize the Babel configuration, you can do so by creating a babel.config.js file in your project root. To use the built-in preset as a base configuration, install the following package and use it npm Yarn pnpm Bun npm install --save @docusaurus/babel yarn add @docusaurus/babel pnpm add @docusaurus/babel bun add @docusaurus/babel Then use the preset in your babel.config.js file: babel.config.js export default { presets : [ '@docusaurus/babel/preset' ] , } ; Most of the time, the default preset configuration will work just fine. If you want to customize your Babel configuration (e.g. to add support for Flow), you can directly edit this file. For your changes to take effect, you need to restart the Docusaurus dev server.

      "text_content": "Version: 3.9.2 Docusaurus is written in TypeScript and provides first-class TypeScript support. The minimum required version is TypeScript 5.1 . Initialization ​ Docusaurus supports writing and using TypeScript theme components. If the init template provides a TypeScript variant, you can directly initialize a site with full TypeScript support by using the --typescript flag. npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic --typescript Below are some guides on how to migrate an existing project to TypeScript. Setup ​ Add the following packages to your project: npm Yarn pnpm Bun npm install --save-dev typescript @docusaurus/module-type-aliases @docusaurus/tsconfig @docusaurus/types yarn add --dev typescript @docusaurus/module-type-aliases @docusaurus/tsconfig @docusaurus/types pnpm add --save-dev typescript @docusaurus/module-type-aliases @docusaurus/tsconfig @docusaurus/types bun add --dev typescript @docusaurus/module-type-aliases @docusaurus/tsconfig @docusaurus/types Then add tsconfig.json to your project root with the following content: tsconfig.json { \"extends\" : \"@docusaurus/tsconfig\" , \"compilerOptions\" : { \"baseUrl\" : \".\" } } Docusaurus doesn't use this tsconfig.json to compile your project. It is added just for a nicer Editor experience, although you can choose to run tsc to type check your code for yourself or on CI. Now you can start writing TypeScript theme components. Typing the config file ​ It is possible to use a TypeScript config file in Docusaurus. docusaurus.config.ts import type { Config } from '@docusaurus/types' ; import type * as Preset from '@docusaurus/preset-classic' ; const config : Config = { title : 'My Site' , favicon : 'img/favicon.ico' , /* Your site config here */ presets : [ [ 'classic' , { /* Your preset config here */ } satisfies Preset . Options , ] , ] , themeConfig : { /* Your theme config here */ } satisfies Preset . ThemeConfig , } ; export default config ; It is also possible to use JSDoc type annotations within a .js file: By default, the Docusaurus TypeScript config does not type-check JavaScript files. The // @ts-check comment ensures the config file is properly type-checked when running npx tsc . docusaurus.config.js // @ts-check /** @type { import ( '@docusaurus/types' ) . Config } */ const config = { tagline : 'Dinosaurs are cool' , favicon : 'img/favicon.ico' , /* Your site config here */ presets : [ [ '@docusaurus/preset-classic' , /** @type { import ( '@docusaurus/preset-classic' ) . Options } */ ( { /* Your preset config here */ } ) , ] , ] , themeConfig : /** @type { import ( '@docusaurus/preset-classic' ) . ThemeConfig } */ ( { /* Your theme config here */ } ) , } ; export default config ; tip Type annotations are very useful and help your IDE understand the type of config objects! The best IDEs (VS Code, WebStorm, IntelliJ...) will provide a nice auto-completion experience. Swizzling TypeScript theme components ​ For themes that support TypeScript theme components, you can add the --typescript flag to the end of the swizzle command to get TypeScript source code. For example, the following command will generate index.tsx and styles.module.css into src/theme/Footer . npm Yarn pnpm Bun npm run swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Footer -- --typescript yarn swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Footer --typescript pnpm run swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Footer --typescript bun run swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic Footer --typescript All official Docusaurus themes support TypeScript theme components, including theme-classic , theme-live-codeblock , and theme-search-algolia . If you are a Docusaurus theme package author who wants to add TypeScript support, see the Lifecycle APIs docs . Initialization Setup Typing the config file Swizzling TypeScript theme components",
